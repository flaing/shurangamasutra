  Thus I have heard.<br>
  At one time the Buddha dwelt in Shravasti in the sublime abode of the Jeta Grove 
  with a gathering of Great Bhikshus, twelve hundred fifty in all.<br>
  All were Great Arhats without outflows, sons of the Buddha, dwellers and maintainers. 
  They had fully transcended all existence, and were able to travel everywhere, 
  and to accomplish the awesome deportment.<br>
  They followed the Buddha in turning the wheel and were wonderfully worthy of 
  the bequest. Stern and pure in the Vinaya, they were great exemplars in the 
  three realms. Their limitless response-bodies took living beings across and 
  liberated them, pulling out and rescuing those of the future so they could transcend 
  all the bonds of dust.<br>
  The names of the leaders were: the greatly wise Shariputra, Mahamaudgalyayana, 
  Mahakaushthila, Purnamaitreyaniputra, Subhuti, Upanishad, and others.<br>
  Moreover limitless pratyekas who were beyond study and those with initial resolve 
  came to where the Buddha was to join the Bhikshus' Pravarana at the close of 
  the summer retreat.<br>
  Bodhisattvas from the ten directions who desired counsel in order to resolve 
  the doubts in their minds were respectful and obedient to the Awesome but Compassionate 
  One as they prepared to seek the secret meaning.<br>
  Then the Tathagata arranged his seat, sat quietly and peacefully, and for the 
  sake of everyone in the assembly proclaimed the profound and mysterious. The 
  pure assembly at the banquet of Dharma obtained what they had never obtained 
  before.<br>
  The Immortal's Kalavinka-sound pervaded the ten directions and Bodhisattvas 
  as numerous as the sands of the Ganges gathered at the Bodhimanda with Manjushri 
  as their leader.<br>
  Then King Prasenajit, for the sake of his father, the late king, arranged on 
  the day of mourning a vegetarian feast and invited the Buddha to the side rooms 
  of the palace. He welcomed the Tathagata in person with a vast array of superb 
  delicacies of unsurpassed wonderful flavors and himself invited the great Bodhisattvas.<br>
  In the city were also elders and laypeople who were also prepared to feed the 
  Sangha at the same time, and they stood waiting for the Buddha to come and receive 
  offerings.<br>
  The Buddha commanded Manjushri to assign the Bodhisattvas and Arhats to receive 
  offerings from the various vegetarian hosts.<br>
  Only Ananda, who, having accepted a special invitation earlier, had travelled 
  far and had not yet returned; was late for the apportioning of the Sangha. No 
  senior-seated or Acharya was with him, so he was returning alone on the road.<br>
  On that day he had received no offerings, and so at the appropriate time Ananda 
  took up his begging bowl and, as he travelled through the city, begged in successive 
  order.<br>
  As the first began to beg, he thought to himself that down to the very last 
  Danapati who would be his vegetarian host he would not question whether they 
  were clean or unclean; whether they were Ksatriyas of honorable name or Chandalas. 
  While practicing equality and compassion he would not merely select the lowly 
  but was determined to perfect all living beings' limitless merit and virtue.<br>
  Ananda already knew that the Tathagata, the World Honored One, had admonished 
  Subhuti and Great Kashyapa for being Arhats whose hearts were not fair and equal, 
  and he regarded with respect the Tathagata's instructions in impartiality, to 
  save everyone from doubt and slander.<br>
  Having crossed the city moat, he walked slowly through the outer gates, his 
  manner stern and proper as he honored with propriety the method of obtaining 
  food.<br>
  At that time, because Ananda was begging in sequential order, he passed by a 
  house of prostitution and was waylaid by a powerful artifice. By means of a 
  mantra of the Kapila religion, formerly of the Brahma Heaven, the daughter of 
  Matangi drew him onto an impure mat.<br>
  With her licentious body she stroked and rubbed him until he was on the verge 
  of destroying the precept substance.<br>
  The Tathagata, knowing Ananda was being taken advantage of by the indecent artifice, 
  finished the meal and immediately returned. The king, great officials, elders, 
  and laypeople followed along after the Buddha, desiring to hear the essentials 
  of Dharma.<br>
  Then The World Honored One emitted a hundred rays of jeweled and fearless light 
  from his crown. Within the light appeared a thousand-petalled precious lotus, 
  upon which was seated a transformation-body Buddha in full lotus posture, proclaiming 
  a spiritual mantra.<br>
  He commanded Manjushri to take the mantra and go provide protection, and, when 
  the evil mantra was extinguished, to lend support, and to encourage Ananda and 
  Matangi's daughter to return to where the Buddha was.<br>
  Ananda saw the Buddha, bowed, and wept sorrowfully, regretting that from time 
  without beginning he had been preoccupied with erudition and had not yet perfected 
  his strength in the Way. He respectfully and repeatedly requested an explanation 
  of the very first expedients of the wonderful Shamatha, Samapatti, and Dhyana, 
  by means of which the Tathagatas of the ten directions had realized Bodhi.<br>
  At that time Bodhisattvas as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, Great Arhats, 
  Pratyekas, and others from the ten directions, were also present. Pleased at 
  the opportunity to listen, they withdrew silently to their seats to receive 
  the sagely instruction.<br>
  In the midst of the great assembly, the World Honored One then extended his 
  golden arm, rubbed Ananda's crown, and said to Ananda and the great assembly, 
  &quot;There is a Samadhi called the King of the Foremost Shurangama at the Great 
  Buddha's Summit Replete with the Myriad Practices; it is a path wonderfully 
  adorned and the single door through which the Tathagatas of the ten directions 
  gained transcendence. You should now listen attentively.&quot; Ananda bowed 
  down to receive the compassionate instruction humbly.<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;You and I are of the same family and share 
  the affection of a natural relationship. At the time of your initial resolve, 
  what were the outstanding characteristics which you saw in my Dharma that caused 
  you to suddenly cast aside the deep kindness and love found in the world?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;I saw the Tathagata's thirty-two characteristics, 
  which were so supremely wonderful, so incomparable, that his entire body had 
  a shimmering transparence just like that of crystal.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I often thought to myself that these characteristics could not be born 
  of desire and love. Why? The vapors of desire are coarse and murky. From foul 
  and putrid intercourse comes a turbid mixture of pus and blood which cannot 
  give off such a magnificent, pure and brilliant concentration of purple-golden 
  light. And so I thirstily gazed upward, followed the Buddha, and let the hair 
  fall from my head.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Very good, Ananda, you should all know that all living 
  beings are continually born and continually die, simply because they do not 
  know the everlasting true mind, the bright substance of the pure nature. Instead 
  they engage in false thinking. It has been so since time without beginning. 
  Their thoughts are not true, and so the wheel keeps turning.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Now you wish to investigate the unsurpassed Bodha and actually discover 
  your nature. You should answer my questions with a straightforward mind, because 
  that is exactly the way the Tathagatas of the ten directions escaped birth and 
  death. Their minds were all straight-forward, and since their minds and words 
  were consistently that way, from the beginning, through the intermediate stages 
  to the end, they were never in the least evasive.<br>
  Ananda, I now ask you: at the time of your initial resolve, which arose in response 
  to the Tathagata's thirty-two characteristics, what was it that saw those characteristics 
  and who delighted in them?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, this is the way I experienced 
  the delight; I used my mind and eyes, because my eyes saw the Tathagata's outstanding 
  characteristics, my mind gave rise to delight. That is why I became resolved 
  and wished to remove myself from birth and death.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;It is as you say, that experience of delight 
  actually occurs because of your mind and eyes. If you do not know where your 
  mind and eyes are, you will not be able to conquer the wearisome dust.<br>
  &quot;For example, when a King's country is invaded by thieves and he sends 
  out his troops to suppress and banish them. The troops must know where the thieves 
  are.<br>
  &quot;It is the fault of your mind and eyes that you flow and turn. I am asking 
  you specifically about your mind and eyes: Where are they now?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, all the ten kinds of living 
  beings in the world alike maintain that the conscious mind dwells within the 
  body; and as I regard the Tathagata's blue lotus-flower eyes, they too are on 
  the Buddha's face.<br>
  I now observe that these prominent organs, four kinds of defiling objects, are 
  on my face, and so, too, my conscious mind actually is within my body.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot; You are now sitting in the Tathagata's lecture 
  hall looking at the Jeta Grove. Where is it at present?&quot;<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, this great many-storied pure lecture hall is in the 
  Garden of the Benefactor of the Solitary. At present the Jeta Grove is in fact 
  outside the hall.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Ananda, as you are now in the hall, what do you see first?&quot;<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, here in the hall I first see the Tathagata, next I 
  see the great assembly, and from there, as I gaze outward, I see the grove and 
  garden.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Ananda, why it is you are able to see the grove and the garden as you 
  look at them?&quot;<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, since the doors and windows of this great lecture hall 
  have been thrown open wide, I can be in the hall and see into the distance.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;It is as you say, when one is in the lecture 
  hall and the doors and windows are open wide, one can see far into the garden 
  and grove. Could there be someone in the hall who does not see the Tathagata 
  and yet sees outside the hall?&quot;<br>
  Ananda answered: &quot;World Honored One, to be in the hall and not see the 
  Tathagata, and yet see the grove and fountains is impossible.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Ananda, you are like that too.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Your mind is capable of understanding everything thoroughly. Now if your 
  present mind, which thoroughly understands everything, were in your body, then 
  you should be aware first of what is inside your body. Can there be living beings 
  who first see inside their bodies before they observe things outside?&quot;<br>
  Even if you cannot see your heart, liver, spleen, and stomach, still, the growing 
  of your nails and hair. The twist of your sinews, and the throb of your pulse 
  should be clearly understood. Why don't you perceive these things? If you cannot 
  perceive what is inside at all, how can you perceive what is outside?<br>
  &quot;Therefore you should know that you state the impossible when you say that 
  the aware and knowing mind is in the body.&quot;<br>
  Ananda bowed his head and said to the Buddha, &quot;Upon hearing such a Dharma-sound 
  as the Tathagata has proclaimed. I realize that my mind is actually outside 
  my body.<br>
  &quot;Why? For example, a lamp alight in a room will certainly illumine the 
  inside of the room first, and only then will it pour through the doorway to 
  reach the recesses of the hall. For all living beings, who do not see within 
  their bodies but only see outside them, it is as if the lighted lamp were placed 
  outside the room, so that it cannot illumine the room.&quot;<br>
  &quot;This principle is certainly clear; it is absolutely beyond all doubt and 
  exactly the Buddha's entire meaning, and so it isn't wrong is it?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;All these Bhikshus have just followed me to 
  the city of Shravasti to beg in sequence for food rolled into balls, and they 
  have returned to the Jeta Grove. I have already finished eating, but consider 
  the Bhikshus: when one person eats, does everyone get full?&quot;<br>
  Ananda answered, &quot;No, World Honored One, Why? These Bhikshus are Arhats, 
  but their individual lives differ. How could one person cause everyone to be 
  full?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;If your mind which understands, knows, sees and 
  is aware were actually outside your body, your body and mind would be mutually 
  exclusive and would have no relationship to one another. The body would be unaware 
  of what the mind perceives, and the mind would not perceive the awareness within 
  the body. <br>
  &quot;Now as I show you my tula-cotton hand, does your mind distinguish it when 
  your eyes see it?&quot;<br>
  Ananda answered, &quot;So, it is, World Honored One.&quot; The Buddha told Ananda, 
  &quot;If there is a common perception, how then can the mind be outside?&quot;<br>
  &quot;Therefore you should know you state the impossible when you say that the 
  mind which knows, understands, and is aware is outside the body.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, it is as the Buddha has 
  said, since I cannot see inside, my mind does not reside in the body. Since 
  my body and mind have a common awareness, they are not separate and so my mind 
  does not dwell outside my body. As I now consider it, I know it is in a certain 
  place.<br>
  The Buddha said: &quot;Now where is it?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;Since the mind which knows and understands does not perceive 
  what is inside but can see outside, upon reflection I believe it is concealed 
  in the organ of vision.&quot;<br>
  &quot;For example, when someone places crystal bowls over his eyes, the bowls 
  cover his eyes but do not obstruct his vision. The organ of vision is thus able 
  to see, and discriminations are made accordingly.<br>
  &quot;And so my mind which knows, understands, and is aware does not see within 
  because it resides in the organ; it can gaze outside clearly, without obstruction 
  for the same reason: it is concealed in the organ.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;Assuming that it is concealed in the organ, 
  as you assert in your analogy of the crystals: when someone covers his eyes 
  with the crystals and looks at the mountains and rivers, does he see the crystals 
  as well?&quot;<br>
  &quot;Yes, World Honored One, when that person covers his eyes with the crystals, 
  he does in fact see the crystals.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;If your mind is analogous to the eyes covered 
  with crystals, then when you see the mountains and rivers, why don't you see 
  your eyes?&quot;<br>
  &quot;If you could see your eyes, your eyes would be part of the external environment. 
  If you cannot see them, why did you say that the mind which understands, knows, 
  and is aware is concealed in the organ of vision as eyes are covered by crystals?&quot;<br>
  Therefore you should know that you state the impossible when you say that the 
  mind which knows, understands, and is aware is concealed in the organ of vision 
  in the way that the eyes are covered by crystals.<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, I now offer this reconsideration: 
  viscera and bowels lie inside the bodies of living beings, while the apertures 
  are outside. There is darkness at the bowels and light at the apertures.&quot;<br>
  Now, as I face the Buddha and open my eyes, I see light: that is to see outside. 
  When I close my eyes and see darkness, that is to see within. How does that 
  principle sound?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;When you close your eyes and see darkness, 
  does the darkness you experience lie before your eyes? If it does lie before 
  your eyes, then the darkness is in front of your eyes. How can that be said 
  to be 'within'?&quot;<br>
  &quot;If it is within, then when you are in a dark room without the light of 
  sun, moon, or lamps. The darkness in the room would constitute your 'warmers' 
  and viscera. If it is not before you, how can it be seen?<br>
  &quot;But suppose there is an inward seeing that is distinct from seeing outside. 
  In that case, when you close your eyes and see darkness, you are seeing inside 
  the body. Therefore, when you open your eyes and see light, why can't you see 
  your own face?<br>
  &quot;If you cannot see your face, then there can be no seeing within. If you 
  can see your face, then your mind which knows and understands and your organ 
  of vision as well must be suspended in space. How could they be inside?<br>
  &quot;If they are in space, then they are not part of your body. Otherwise the 
  Tathagata who now sees your face should be part of the your body as well.<br>
  &quot;In that case, when your eyes perceive something, your body would remain 
  unaware of it. If you press the point and say that the body and eyes each have 
  'an' awareness, then you should have two perceptions, and your one body should 
  eventually become two Buddhas.<br>
  &quot;Therefore you should know that you state the impossible when you say that 
  to see darkness is to see within.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;I have heard the Buddha instruct the four assemblies 
  that because the mind arises, every kind of Dharma arises, and that because 
  Dharmas arise, every kind of mind arises.<br>
  As I now consider it, the substance of that very consideration is truly the 
  nature of the mind. Wherever it comes together with things, the mind exists 
  in response. It does not exit in the three locations of inside, outside and 
  in between.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;Now you say that because Dharmas arise, every 
  kind of mind arises. Wherever it comes together with things, the mind exists 
  in response. But if it has no substance, the mind cannot come together with 
  anything. If, having no substance, it can yet come together with things, that 
  would constitute a nineteenth realm brought about by a union with the seventh 
  defiling object, and there is no such principle.<br>
  &quot;If it does have substance, when you pinch your body with your hand, does 
  your mind which perceives it come out from the inside or in from the outside? 
  If it comes out from the inside, then, once again, it should see within your 
  body. If it comes in from outside, it should see your face first.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;Seeing is done with the eyes. The mind's perception is not 
  that of the eyes. To say it sees doesn't make sense.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Supposing that the eyes can see: then when you are in 
  a room, the doors should be able to see. Also, when someone has died but his 
  eyes are still intact, his eyes should see things. How can it be death if one 
  can still see?<br>
  &quot;Furthermore, Ananda, if your mind which is aware, understands, and knows 
  in fact has substance, then is it a single substance or many substance? Does 
  its substance perceive the body as it now resides in it or does it not perceive 
  it?<br>
  &quot;Supposing that it is a single substance, then when you pinch one limb 
  with your hand, the four limbs would be aware of it. If they all were aware 
  of it, the pinch could not be at any one place. If the pinch is located in one 
  place, then the single substance you propose is not possible.<br>
  &quot;Supposing that it has many substance: then you would be many people. Which 
  substance are you?<br>
  &quot;Supposing it is a pervasive substance: the case is the same as before 
  in the instance of pinching. But supposing it is not pervasive; then when you 
  touch your head and touch your foot, the foot would not perceive it if the head 
  does. But that is not how you are.<br>
  &quot;Therefore you should know that you state the impossible when you say that 
  wherever it comes together with things, the mind exists in response.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, I also have heard the Buddha 
  discuss true appearance with Manjushri and the other disciples of the Dharma 
  King. The World Honored One also said, 'the mind is not inside and it is not 
  outside.'<br>
  &quot;As I now consider it, if it were within, it would see things it does not 
  see; if it were outside, there would be no common perception. Since it cannot 
  see inside, it cannot be inside; and since the body and mind have common perception, 
  it does not make sense to say it is outside. Therefore, since there is a common 
  perception and since there is no seeing within, it must be in the middle.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;You say it is in the middle. That 'middle' must not be 
  haphazard or without a fixed location. Where is this 'middle' that you propose? 
  Is it in an external place, or is it in the body?<br>
  &quot;If it is in the body, it cannot be on the surface of the body since that 
  is not in the middle. But to be in the middle is no different than being inside. 
  If it is in an external place, is there some evidence of it, or is there no 
  evidence? If there is no evidence of it, that is the same as if it does not 
  exist. If there is evidence of it, then it has no fixed location.<br>
  &quot;Why? Suppose that someone were to indicate the middle by a marker. When 
  regarded from the east, it would be to the west, and when regarded from the 
  south, it would be the north. The marker is unclear, and the mind would be equally 
  chaotic.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;The middle I speak of is neither of those. As the World Honored 
  One has said, the eyes and forms are the conditions which create the eye-consciousness. 
  The eyes make discriminations; forms have no perception, but consciousness is 
  created between them: that is where my mind is.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;If your mind is between the eye and an object, does the 
  mind's substance combine with the two or does it not?<br>
  &quot;If it does combine with the two, then objects and the mind-substance will 
  form a chaotic mixture. Since objects have no perception, the two stand in opposition. 
  Which is the middle?<br>
  &quot;If it does not combine with the two, it will then be nether perceiver 
  nor perceived and will have no substance or nature. Where is the characteristic 
  of 'middle'?<br>
  &quot;Therefore you should know that for the mind to be in the middle is impossible.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, when I have seen the Buddha 
  turn the Dharma wheel in the past with Great Maudgalyayana, Subhuti, Purna, 
  and Shariputra , four of the great disciples, he often said that the nature 
  of the mind which perceives, makes discriminations, and is aware is located 
  neither within nor outside nor in the middle; it is not located anywhere at 
  all. That very non-attachment to anything is what is called the mind. Therefore, 
  is my non-attachment my mind?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;You say that the nature of the mind which perceives, 
  makes discriminations, and is aware is not located anywhere at all. The entirety 
  of things existing in the world consists of space, the waters, the land, the 
  creatures that fly and walk, and all external objects. Does your non-attachment 
  also exist?&quot;<br>
  If it does not exist, it is the same as hairs on a tortoise or horns on a rabbit. 
  How can you speak of non-attachment?<br>
  If non-attachment exists, it cannot be said to be non-existent. To be non-existent 
  is to be without characteristics. To be existent is to have characteristics. 
  Whatever has characteristics has a location; how then can be said to be unattached?<br>
  &quot;Therefore you should know, to call the aware, knowing mind to be non-attachment 
  to anything is impossible.<br>
  Then Ananda arose from his seat in the midst of the Great Assembly, uncovered 
  his right shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, respectfully put his 
  palms together, and said to the Buddha:<br>
  &quot;I am the Tathagata's youngest cousin. I have received the Buddha's compassionate 
  love and have left the home-life, but I have been dependent on his affection, 
  and as a consequence have pursued erudition and am not yet without outflows.<br>
  I could not overcome the Kapila mantra. I was spun around by it and sank in 
  the house of prostitution, all because I did not know the location of the realm 
  of reality.<br>
  I only hope that the World Honored One, out of great kindness and pity, will 
  instruct us in the path of Shamatha to guide the Icchantikas and overthrow the 
  Mlecchas.<br>
  After he had finished speaking, he placed his five limbs on the ground along 
  with the entire great assembly. Then they stood on tip-toe waiting attentively 
  and thirstily to respectfully hear the instructions.<br>
  Then the World Honored One radiated forth from his face various kinds of light, 
  dazzling light as brilliant as hundreds of thousands of suns. <br>
  The six kinds of quaking pervaded the Buddharealms, and thus lands as many as 
  fine motes of dust throughout the ten directions appeared simultaneously.<br>
  The Buddha's awesome spirit caused all the realms to unite into a single realm.<br>
  And in these realms all the great Bodhisattvas, each remaining in his own country, 
  put their palms together and listened.<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;All living beings, from beginningless time 
  onward and in all kinds of upsidedown ways, have created seeds of karma which 
  naturally run their course, like the Aksha cluster.<br>
  &quot;The reason those who cultivate cannot accomplish unsurpassed Bodhi, but 
  instead reach the level of a Sound-hearer or of One-enlightened-to-conditions, 
  or become accomplished in outside ways as Heaven-dwellers or as Demon-kings 
  or as members of the retinue of demons is that they do not know the two fundamental 
  roots and are mistaken and confused in their cultivation. They are like one 
  who cooks sand in the hope of creating savory delicacies. They may pass through 
  as many aeons as there are motes of dust, but in the end they will not obtain 
  what they want.<br>
  &quot;What are the two? Ananda, the first is the root of beginningless birth 
  and death, which is the mind that seizes upon conditions and that you and all 
  living beings now make use of, taking it to be the self-nature.<br>
  &quot;The second is the primal pure substance of the beginningless Bodhi Nirvana. 
  It is the primal bright essence of consciousness that can bring forth all conditions. 
  Because of conditions, you consider it to be lost.<br>
  &quot;Living beings lose sight if the original brightness: therefore, though 
  they use it to the end of their days, they are unaware of it, and without intending 
  to they enter the various destinies.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, now you wish to know about the path of Shamatha with the hope 
  of getting out of birth and death, again I ask you&#133;&quot;<br>
  Then the Tathagata raised his golden arm and bent his five wheeled fingers as 
  he asked Ananda, &quot;Do you see?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;I see.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;What do you see?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;I see the Tathagata raise his arm and bend his fingers into 
  a fist of light which dazzles my mind and my eyes.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;What do you see it with?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;The members of the great assembly and I each see it with 
  our eyes.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;You have answered me by saying that the Tathagata 
  bends his fingers into a fist of light which dazzles your mind and eyes. Your 
  eyes are able to see, but what is the mind that is dazzled by my fist?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;The Tathagata is asking where the mind is located. Now that 
  I use my mind to search for it thoroughly, I propose that precisely what is 
  able to investigate is my mind.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Hey! Ananda, that is not your mind.&quot;<br>
  Startled, Ananda leapt from his seat, stood and put his palms together, and 
  said to the Buddha, &quot;If it's not my mind, what is it?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;It is your perception of false appearances 
  based on external objects which deludes your true nature and has caused you 
  from beginningless time to your present life to recognize a thief as your son, 
  to lose your eternal source, and to undergo the wheel's turning.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, I am the Buddha's favorite 
  cousin. It is because my mind loved the Buddha that I was led to leave the home-life. 
  It is my mind that not only makes offerings to the Tathagata, but also, in passing 
  through lands as many as the grains of sand in the Ganges River to serve all 
  Buddhas and good, wise advisors, and in martialing great courage to practice 
  every difficult aspect of the Dharma, I always use this mind. Even if I am slandering 
  the Dharma and eternally withdrawing my good roots, it would also be because 
  of this mind. If this is not my mind, then I have no mind, and I am the same 
  as a clod of earth or a piece of wood, because there is nothing that is apart 
  from this awareness and knowing.<br>
  &quot;Why does the Tathagata say this is not my mind? I am startled and frightened 
  and not one member of the great assembly is without doubt. I only hope that 
  the World Honored One will regard us with great compassion and instruct those 
  who have not yet awakened.&quot;<br>
  Then the World Honored One gave instruction to Ananda and the great assembly, 
  wishing to cause their minds to enter the State of Patience with the Non-production 
  of Dharmas.<br>
  From the Lion's seat he rubbed Ananda's crown and said to him, &quot;The Tathagata 
  has often said that all Dharmas that arise are only manifestations of the mind. 
  All causes and effects, the worlds as many as fine motes of dust, come into 
  being because of the mind.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, when all the things in the world, including blades of grass and 
  strands of silk thread, are examined at their fundamental source, each is seen 
  to have substance and a nature, even empty space has a name and an appearance.<br>
  &quot;How much the less could the clear, wonderful, pure bright mind, the essence 
  of all thought, itself be without substance?<br>
  &quot;If you insists that the nature which knows and observes and is aware of 
  distinctions is the mind, then apart from all forms, smells, tastes, and touches-apart 
  from the workings of all the defiling objects-that mind should have its own 
  complete nature.<br>
  &quot;And yet now, as you listen to my Dharma, it is because of sound that you 
  are able to make distinctions.<br>
  Even if you could extinguish all seeing, hearing, awareness, and knowing, and 
  maintain an inner composure, the shadows of your discrimination of Dharmas would 
  remain.<br>
  &quot;I do not insist that you grant that it is not the mind. But examine your 
  mind in minute detail to see whether there is a discrimination nature apart 
  from the objects of sense. That would truly be your mind.<br>
  &quot;If this discrimination nature has no substance apart from objects, then 
  it is shadows of discriminations of objects of mind.<br>
  &quot;The objects are not permanent, and when they pass out of existence, such 
  a mind would be like hair on a tortoise or horns on a rabbit. In that case your 
  Dharma-body would be extinguished along with it. Then who cultivates and attains 
  Patience with the Non-production of Dharmas?&quot;<br>
  At that point Ananda and everyone in the great assembly was speechless and at 
  a total loss.<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;There are cultivators in the world who, although 
  they realize the nine successive stages of Samadhi, do not achieve the extinction 
  of outflows or become Arhats, all because they are attached to birth-and-death 
  false thinking and mistake it for what is truly real. That is why now, although 
  you are greatly learned, you have not realized the accomplishment of sagehood.&quot;<br>
  When Ananda heard that, he again wept sorrowfully, placed his five limbs on 
  the ground, knelt on both knees, put his palms together, and said to the Buddha, 
  &quot;Since I followed the Buddha and left home, what I have done is to rely 
  on the Buddha's awesome spirit. I have often thought, 'there is no reason for 
  me to toil at cultivation' expecting that the Tathagata would bestow Samadhi 
  upon me. I never realized that he could not stand in for me in body and mind. 
  Thus, I lost my original mind and although my body has left the home-life, my 
  mind has not entered the Way. I am like the poor son who renounced his father 
  and roamed around.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, today I realize that although I am greatly learned, if I do 
  not cultivate, it is the same as if I had not learned anything; just as someone 
  who only speaks of food will never get full.&quot;<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, now we all are bound by two obstructions and as a consequence 
  do not perceive the still, permanent nature of the mind. I only hope the Tathagata 
  will take pity on us poor and destitute ones and disclose the wonderful bright 
  mind, and open my Way-eye.&quot;<br>
  Then from the character wan &quot;myriad&quot; on his chest, the Tathagata poured 
  forth precious light. Radiant with hundreds of thousands of colors, the brilliant 
  light simultaneously pervaded everywhere throughout the ten directions to Buddha-realms 
  as many as fine motes of dust, anointing the crowns of every Tathagata in all 
  the jeweled Buddhalands of the ten directions. Then it swept back to Ananda 
  and all in the great assembly.<br>
  And said to Ananda, &quot;I will now erect the great Dharma banner for you, 
  to cause all living beings in the ten directions to obtain the wondrous subtle 
  secret, the pure nature, the bright mind, and to attain the pure eye.&quot;</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>VOLUME 2<br></b>
  &quot;Ananda, you have told me that you saw my fist of bright light. How did 
  it take the form of a fist? How did the fist become bright? By what means could 
  you see it?&quot;<br>
  Ananda replied, &quot;The body of the Buddha is born of purity and cleanness, 
  and, therefore, it assumes the color of Jambu River gold with deep red hues. 
  Hence, it shone as brilliant and dazzling as a precious mountain. It was actually 
  my eyes that saw the Buddha bending his five-wheeled fingers to form a fist 
  which was shown to all of us.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;Today the Tathagata will tell you truly. That 
  all those with wisdom are able to achieve enlightenment through the use of examples.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, take for example, my fist: if I didn't have a hand, I couldn't 
  make a fist. If you didn't have eyes, you couldn't see. If you apply the example 
  of my fist to the case of your eyes, is the idea the same?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;Yes, World Honored One. Since I can't see without my eyes, 
  if one applies the example of the Buddha's fist to the case of my eyes, the 
  idea is the same.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;You say it is the same, but that is not right. 
  Why? If a person has no hand, his fist is gone forever. But one who is without 
  eyes is not entirely devoid of sight.<br>
  &quot;For what reason? Try consulting a blind man on the street: 'What do you 
  see?'<br>
  &quot;Any blind man will certainly answer, 'Now I see only black in front of 
  my eyes. Nothing else meets my gaze.'<br>
  &quot;The meaning is apparent: if he sees blackness in front of him, how could 
  his seeing be considered 'lost'?&quot;<br>
  Anada said, &quot;The only thing blind people see in front of their eyes is 
  blackness. How can that be seeing?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;Is there any difference between the blackness 
  seen by blind people, who do not have the use of their eyes, and the blackness 
  seen by someone who has the use of his eyes when he is in a dark room?&quot;<br>
  &quot;So it is, World Honored One. Between the two kinds of blackness, that 
  seen by the person in a dark room and that seen by the blind, there is no difference.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if the person without the use of his eyes who sees only blackness 
  were suddenly to regain his sight and see all kinds of forms, and you say it 
  is his eyes which sees, then when the person in a dark room who only sees all 
  kinds of forms because a lamp is lit, you should say it is the lamp which sees.<br>
  &quot;If it is a case of the lamp seeing, it would be a lamp endowed with sight-which 
  couldn't be called a lamp. And if the lamp were to do the seeing, how would 
  you be involved?<br>
  &quot;Therefore you should know that while the lamp can reveal the forms, it 
  is the eyes, not the lamp, that do the seeing. And while the eyes can reveal 
  the forms, the seeing-nature comes from the mind, not the eyes.&quot;<br>
  Although Ananda and everyone in the great assembly had heard what was said, 
  their minds had not yet understood, and so they remained silent. Hoping to hear 
  more of the gentle sounds of the minds, and stood waiting for the Tathagata's 
  compassionate instruction.<br>
  Then the World Honored One extended his tula-cotton webbed bright hand, opened 
  his five-wheeled fingers, and told Ananda and the great assembly, &quot;When 
  I first accomplished the way I went to the Deer Park, and for the sake of Ajnatakaundinya 
  and all five of the Bhikshus, as well as for you of the four-fold assembly, 
  I said, 'It is because living beings are impeded by guest-dust and affliction 
  that they do not realize Bodhi or become Arhats.' At that time, what caused 
  you who have now realized the holy fruit to become enlightened?&quot;<br>
  Then Ajnatakaundinya arose and said to the Buddha, &quot;Of the elders now present 
  in the great assembly, only I received the name 'Understanding' because I was 
  enlightened to the meaning of the word 'guest-dust' and realized the fruition.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, it is like a traveller who stops as a guest at a roadside 
  inn, perhaps for the night or perhaps for a meal. When he has finished lodging 
  there or when the meal is finished, he packs his baggage and sets out again. 
  He does not remain there at leisure. The host himself, however, does not go 
  far away.<br>
  &quot;Considering it this way, the one who does not remain is called the guest, 
  and the one who does remain is called the host. The word 'guest' then, means 
  'one who does not remain.'<br>
  &quot;Again, when the sky clears up, the morning sun rises with all resplendence, 
  and its golden rays stream into a house through a crevice to reveal particles 
  of dust in the air. The dust dances in the rays of light, but the empty space 
  is motionless.<br>
  &quot;Considering it this way, what is clear and still is called space, and 
  what moves is called dust. The word 'dust' then, means 'that which moves.'&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;So it is.&quot;<br>
  Then in the midst of the great assembly, The Thus Come One bent his five-wheeled 
  fingers. After bending them, he opened them again. After he opened them, he 
  bent them again, and he asked Ananda, &quot;What do you see now?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;I see The Thus Come One's hundred-jeweled wheeled palms opening 
  and closing in the midst of the assembly.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;You see my hand open and close in the assembly. 
  Is it my hand that opens and closes, or is it your seeing that opens and closes?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;The World Honored One's jeweled hand opened and closed in 
  the assembly. I saw The Thus Come One's hand itself open and close; it was not 
  my seeing-nature that opened and closed.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;What moves and what is still?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;The Buddha's hand does not remain at rest. And since my seeing-nature 
  is beyond even stillness, how could it not be at rest?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;So it is.&quot;<br>
  Then from his wheeled palm The Thus Come One sent a precious ray of light flying 
  to Ananda's right. Ananda immediately turned his head and glanced to the right. 
  He then sent another ray of light to Ananda's left. Ananda again turned his 
  head and glanced to the left. The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;Why did your 
  head move just now?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;I saw the Thus Come One emit a wonderful precious light which 
  came by my left and right, and so I looked to the left and right, my head moved 
  of itself.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Ananda, when you glanced at the Buddha's light and moved your seeing that 
  moved?&quot;<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, my head moved of itself. Since my seeing-nature is 
  beyond even cessation, how could it move?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;So it is.&quot;<br>
  Then the Thus Come One told everyone in the great assembly, &quot;Suppose other 
  living beings called what moves 'the dust' and what does not dwell 'the guest'?<br>
  &quot;You noticed that is was Ananda's head that moved; the seeing did not move. 
  You also noticed that is was my hand which opened and closed; the seeing did 
  not stretch or bend.<br>
  &quot;Why do you continue to take something moving like your body and its environment 
  to be in substantial existence, so that from the beginning to the end, your 
  every thought is subject to production and extinction?<br>
  &quot;You have lost your true nature and conduct yourselves in upside-down ways. 
  Having lost your true nature and mind, you recognize objects as yourself, and 
  it is you who cling to the flowing and turning of the revolving wheel.&quot;<br>
  When Ananda and the great assembly heard the Buddha's instructions, they become 
  peaceful and composed both in body and mind. They recollected that since time 
  without beginning, they had strayed from their fundamental true mind by mistaking 
  the shadows of their causally conditioned differentiating minds as something 
  real and substantial. Now on this day they had awakened to such illusions and 
  misconceptions. Like a lost infant who rejoins its beloved mother after a long 
  separation, they put their palms together to make obeisance to the Buddha.<br>
  They wished to hear such words from Thus Come One as to enlighten them to the 
  dual nature of body and mind-what is false and what is real, what is empty and 
  what is substantial, what is subject to production and extinction and what transcends 
  production and extinction.<br>
  Then King Prasenajit rose and said to the Buddha, &quot;In the past, when I 
  had not yet received the teachings of the Buddha, I met Katyayana and Vairatiputra, 
  both of whom said that this body is annihilated after death, and that this is 
  Nirvana. Now, although I have met the Buddha, I still have doubts about their 
  words. How much I wish to be enlightened to the ways and means to perceive and 
  realize the true mind, thereby proving that it transcends production and extinction! 
  All those who have outflows also wish to be instructed on this subject.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to the great King, &quot;Now I ask you, as it is now is your 
  physical body like Vajra, indestructible and living forever? Or does it change 
  and go bad?&quot;<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, this body of mine will keep changing until it eventually 
  becomes extinct.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Great King, you have not yet become extinct. How do you 
  know you will become extinct?&quot;<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, although my impermanent, changing, and decaying body 
  has not yet become extinct, I observe it now, and every passing thought fades 
  away. Each new one fails to remain, but gradually perishes like fire turning 
  to ashes. This perishing without cease convinces me that this body will eventually 
  become completely extinct.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;So it is.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Great King, at your present age you are already old and declining. How 
  do your appearance and complexion compare to when you were a youth?&quot;<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, in the past when I was young my skin was moist and 
  shining. When I reached the prime of life, my blood and breath were full. But 
  now in my declining years, as I race into old age, my form is withered and wizened 
  and my spirit dull. My hair is white and my face is in wrinkles and I haven't 
  much time remaining. How can I be compared to how I was when I was full of life?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Great King, your appearance should not decline so suddenly.&quot;<br>
  The King said, &quot;World Honored One, the changes has been a hidden transformation 
  of which I honestly have not been aware. I have come to this gradually through 
  the passing of winters and summers.<br>
  &quot;How did it happen? In my twenties, I was still young, but my features 
  had aged since the time I was ten. My thirties were a further decline from my 
  twenties, and now at sixty-two I look back on my fifties as hale and hearty.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, I am contemplating these hidden transformations. Although 
  the changes wrought by this process of dying are evident through the decades, 
  I might consider them further in finer detail: these changes do not occur just 
  in periods of twelve years; there are actually changes year by year. Not only 
  are there yearly changes, there are also monthly transformations. Nor does it 
  stop at monthly transformations; there are also differences day by day. Examining 
  them closely, I find that Kshana by Kshana, thought after thought, they never 
  stop.&quot;<br>
  &quot;And so I know my body will keep changing until it is extinct.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told the great King, &quot;By watching the ceaseless changes of these 
  transformations, you awaken and know of your extinction, but do you also know 
  that at the time of extinction there is something in your body which does not 
  become extinct?&quot;<br>
  King Prasenajit put his palms together and exclaimed, &quot;I really do not 
  know.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;I will now show you the nature which is not produced 
  and not extinguished.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Great King, how old were you when you saw the waters of the Ganges?&quot;<br>
  The King said, &quot;When I was three years old my compassionate mother led 
  me to visit the Goddess Jiva. We passed a river, and at the time I knew it was 
  the waters of the Ganges.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Great King, you have said that when you were twenty you 
  had deteriorated from when you were ten. Day by day, month by month, year by 
  year until you have reached sixty, in thought after thought there has been change. 
  Yet when you saw the Ganges River at the age of three, how was it different 
  from when you were thirteen?&quot;<br>
  The king said, &quot;It was no difference from when I was three, and even now 
  when I am sixty-two it is still no difference.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Now you are mournful that your hair is white and your 
  face is wrinkled. In the same way that your face is definitely more wrinkled 
  than it was in your youth, has the seeing with which you look at the Ganges 
  aged, so that it is old now but was young when you looked at the river as a 
  child in the past?&quot;<br>
  The King said, &quot;No, World Honored One.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Great King, you face is in wrinkles, but the essential 
  nature of your seeing has not yet wrinkled. What wrinkles are subject to change. 
  What does not wrinkle does not change.&quot;<br>
  &quot;What changes will become extinct, but what does not change is fundamentally 
  free of production and extinction. How can it be subject to your birth and death? 
  Furthermore, why brings up what Maskari Goshaliputra and the others say: that 
  after the death of this body there is total extinction?&quot;<br>
  The King heard these words, believed them, and realized that when the life of 
  this body is finished, there will be rebirth. He and the entire great assembly 
  were greatly delighted at having obtained what they had never had before.<br>
  Ananda then arose from his seat, made obeisance to the Buddha, put his palms 
  together, knelt on both knees, and said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, 
  if this seeing and hearing are indeed neither produced nor extinguished, why 
  did the World Honored One refer to us as people who have lost their true natures 
  and who go about things in an upside-down way? I hope the World Honored One 
  will give rise to great compassion and wash my dust and defilement away.&quot;<br>
  Then the Thus Come One let his golden arm fall so that his wheeled fingers pointed 
  downward, and, showing Ananda, he said, &quot; you see my Mudra-hand: is it 
  right side up or upside down?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;Living beings in the world take it to be upside down. I do 
  not know what is right side up and what is upside down.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;If people of the world take this as down, what 
  do people of the world take to be right-side up?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;They call it right-side up when the Thus Come One raises 
  his arm, with the fingers of his tula-cotton hand pointing upward in the air.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha then held up his hand and said: &quot;Worldly people are doubly deluded 
  when they discriminate between an upright and inverted hand.<br>
  &quot;In the same way they will differentiate between your body and the Thus 
  Come One's pure Dharma body and will say that the Thus Come One's body is one 
  of right and universal knowledge, while your body is upside down.<br>
  &quot;But examine your bodies and the Buddha's closely for this upside-downness: 
  what exactly does the term 'upside down' refer to?&quot;<br>
  Thereupon Ananda and the entire great assembly were dazed, and they stared unblinking 
  at the Buddha. They did not know in what way their bodies and minds were upside 
  down.<br>
  The Buddha's compassion arose and he took pity on Ananda and on all in the great 
  assembly and he spoke to the great assembly in a voice that swept over them 
  like the ocean-tide.<br>
  &quot;All of you good people, I have often said that form and mind and all conditions, 
  as well as Dharmas pertaining to the mind-all the conditioned Dharmas-are manifestations 
  of the mind only. Your bodies and your minds all appear within the wonder of 
  the bright, true, essential, wonderful mind.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Why do I say that you have lost track of what is fundamentally wonderful 
  in you, the perfect, wonderful bright mind, and that in the midst of your bright 
  and enlightened nature, you mistake the false for the real because of ignorance 
  and delusion?<br>
  &quot;Mental dimness turns into dull emptiness. This emptiness, in the dimness, 
  unites with darkness to become form.<br>
  &quot;Stimulated by false thinking, the form takes the shape of a body.<br>
  &quot;As causal conditions come together there are perpetual internal disturbances 
  which tend to gallop outside. Such inner disturbances are often mistaken for 
  the nature of mind.<br>
  &quot;The primary misconception about the mind and body is the false view that 
  the mind dwells in the physical body.<br>
  &quot;You do not know that the physical body, as well as the mountains, the 
  rivers, empty space, and the great earth are all within the wonderful bright 
  true mind.<br>
  &quot;It is like ignoring hundreds if thousands of clear pure seas and taking 
  notice of only a single bubble, seeing it as the entire ocean, as the whole 
  expanse of great and small seas.<br>
  &quot;You people are doubly deluded among the deluded. Such inversion does not 
  differ from that caused by my lowered hand. The Thus Come One says you are most 
  pitiable.&quot;<br>
  Having received the Buddha's compassionate rescue and profound instruction, 
  Ananda's tears fell, and he folded his hands and said to the Buddha, &quot;I 
  have heard these wonderful sounds of the Buddha and have realized that the wonderful 
  bright mind is fundamentally perfect; it is the permanently dwelling mind-ground.<br>
  &quot;But now in awakening to the Dharma-sounds that the Buddha is speaking, 
  it is my conditioned mind which I use to contemplate them reverently. Having 
  just obtained the mind, I do not acknowledge that it is the fundamental mind-ground.<br>
  &quot;I pray that the Buddha will take pity on me and proclaim the perfect sound 
  to pull out my doubts by the roots and enable me to return to the unsurpassed 
  way.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;You still listen to the Dharma with the conditioned 
  mind, and so the Dharma becomes conditioned as well, and you do not obtain the 
  Dharma-nature. It is like when someone points his finger at the moon to show 
  it to someone else. Guided by the finger, that person should see the moon. If 
  he looks at the finger instead and mistakes it for the moon, he loses not only 
  the moon but the finger also. Why? It is because he mistakes the pointing finger 
  for the bright moon.<br>
  &quot;Not only does he lose the finger, but he also fails to recognize light 
  and darkness. Why? He mistakes the substance of the finger for the bright nature 
  of the moon, and so he does not understand the two natures of light and darkness. 
  The same is true of you.<br>
  &quot;If you take what distinguishes the sound of my speaking Dharma to be your 
  mind, then that mind itself, apart from the sound which is distinguished, should 
  have a nature which makes distinctions. It is like the guest who lodges overnight 
  at an inn; he stops temporarily and then goes on. He does not dwell there permanently, 
  whereas the innkeeper does not go anywhere: he is the host of the inn.<br>
  &quot;Likewise, if it is truly your mind, it does not go anywhere. However, 
  in the absence of sound it has no discriminating nature of its own. Can you 
  tell the reason why?<br>
  &quot;This, then, applies not only to the distinguished of sound; in distinguishing 
  my appearance, there is no distinction-making nature apart from the mark of 
  form.<br>
  &quot;Thus even when the making of distinctions is totally absent, when there 
  is no form and no emptiness-the obscurity which Goshali and the others take 
  to be the 'Profound Truth'-in the absence of causal conditions, the distinction-making 
  nature ceases to exist.<br>
  &quot;How can we say that the nature of your mind plays the part of host since 
  everything perceived by it returns to something else?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;If every state of our mind returns to something else as its 
  cause, when why does the wonderful bright original mind mentioned by the Buddha 
  return nowhere? I hold out the hope that the Buddha will shower us with such 
  compassion as to enlighten us on this point.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;As you now see me, the essence of your seeing 
  is fundamentally bright. If the profound bright original mind is compared to 
  the moon, the essence of your seeing is the second moon rather than its reflection.<br>
  &quot;You should listen attentively, for I am now going to show you the place 
  of no returning.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, this great lecture hall is open to the east. It is flooded with 
  light when the sun rises in the sky. It is dark at midnight during a new moon 
  or when obscured by clouds or fog. Looking out through open doors and windows 
  your vision is unimpeded; facing walls or houses your vision is hindered. Your 
  vision is causally conditioned in such places where there are forms of distinctive 
  features; in dull void, you can see only emptiness. You vision will be distorted 
  when the objects of seeing are shrouded in dust and vapor; you will perceive 
  clear when the air is fresh.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, observe all these transitory characteristics as I now return each 
  to its place of origin. What are the basic origins? Ananda, among all these 
  transitions, the light returns to the sun. Why? Without the sun there is no 
  light; therefore the reason for 'light' belongs with the sun, and so it can 
  be returned to the sun.<br>
  &quot; 'Darkness' returns to the new moon. 'Penetration' returns to the doors 
  and windows,while 'obstruction' returns to the walls and eaves. 'Conditions' 
  return to distinctions. 'Emptiness' returns to dull emptiness. 'Darkness and 
  distortion' return to the mist and haze. 'Bright purity' returns to freshness, 
  and nothing that exists in this world goes beyond these kinds.&quot;<br>
  &quot;To which of the eight states of perception will the essence of your seeing 
  return? Why do I ask? The answer lies in the fact that if it is returned to 
  brightness, you will not see darkness when there is no light. Although such 
  states of perception as light, darkness, and the like differ from one another, 
  your seeing remains unchanged.<br>
  &quot;That which can be returned to other sources is clearly not you; that which 
  can be returned nowhere is none other than you.<br>
  &quot;Therefore I know that your mind is fundamentally wonderful, bright, and 
  pure. You yourself are confused and deluded. You miss what is fundamental, and 
  you are caught in the turning wheel of the six paths, tossing and floating on 
  the stormy sea of birth and death all the time. No wonder the Thus Come One 
  says that you are the most pitiable of creatures.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;I recognize that the seeing-nature does not return to anything, 
  but how can I come to know that it is my true nature?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;Now I have a question for you. At this point you 
  have not yet attained the purity of no-outflows. Blessed by the Buddha's spiritual 
  strength, you are able to see into the first Dhyana heavens without any obstruction, 
  just as Aniruddha looks at Jambudvipa with such clarity as he might an Amala 
  fruit in the palm of his hand.<br>
  &quot;Bodhisattvas can see hundreds of thousands of realms. The Thus Come Ones 
  of the ten directions see everything throughout the pure lands as numbers as 
  fine motes of dust. Living beings' sight does not extend a fraction of an inch.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, as you and I now look at the palace where the Four Heavenly Kings 
  reside, and inspect all that moves in the water, on dry land, and in the air, 
  some are dark and some are bright, varying in shape and appearance, yet all 
  are nothing but dust before us-distinctions and obstructions.<br>
  &quot;Among them you should distinguish which is self and which is other. I 
  ask you now to select from within your seeing which is the substance of the 
  self and which is the appearance of things.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if you take a good look at everything everywhere within the range 
  of your vision extending from the palaces of the sun and moon to the seven gold 
  mountain ranges, all that you see is not you. But things of different features 
  and lights. At closer range you will gradually see clouds floating, birds flying, 
  mind blowing, dust rising, trees, plants, rivers, mountains, grasses, animals, 
  people, all of which are not you but things.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, all things, near and far, have the nature of things. Although 
  each is distinctly different, they are seen with the same pure essence of seeing. 
  Thus all the categories of things have their individual distinctions, but the 
  seeing-nature has no differences. This essential wonderful brightness is most 
  certainly your seeing-nature.<br>
  &quot;If seeing were a thing, then you should also be able to see my seeing.<br>
  &quot;If you say you see my seeing, when we both look at the same thing, then 
  when I am not seeing, why don't you see my not-seeing?<br>
  &quot;If you do see my not-seeing, it is clearly not the thing that I am not 
  seeing. If you do not see my not-seeing, then it is clearly not a thing, and 
  how can you say it is not you?<br>
  &quot;What is more, if your seeing is a thing, things should also see you when 
  you see things. With substance and nature mixed up together, you and I and everyone 
  in the world are no longer in order.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if, when you see, it is you and not I who see, then the seeing-nature 
  pervades everywhere. Therefore whose is it if it is not yours?<br>
  &quot;Why do you have doubts about your own true nature and come to me seeking 
  verification, thinking your nature is not true?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, given that this seeing-nature 
  is certainly mine and nothing else, when the Thus Come One and I regard the 
  palace of the Four Heavenly Kings with its supreme store of jewels and stay 
  at the palace of the sun and moon, this seeing completely pervades the lands 
  of the Saha world. Upon returning to the sublime abode, I only see the monastic 
  grounds and in the pure central hall I only see the eaves and corridors.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, that is how the seeing is. At first its substance pervaded 
  everywhere throughout the one realm, but now in the midst of this room it fills 
  one room only. Does the seeing shrink from great to small, or do the walls and 
  eaves press in and cut it off? Now I do not know where the meaning in this lies 
  and hope the Buddha will let fall his vast compassion and proclaim it for me 
  thoroughly.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;All the aspects of everything in the world, such 
  as big and small, inside and outside, are classed as the dust before you. You 
  should not say the seeing stretches and shrinks.<br>
  &quot;Consider the example of a square container in which a square of emptiness 
  is seen. I ask you further: is the square emptiness that is seen in the square 
  container a fixed square shape, or is it not fixed as a square shape?<br>
  &quot;If it is a fixed square shape, when it is switched to a round container 
  the emptiness would not be round. If it is not a fixed shape, then when it is 
  in the square container it should not be a square-shaped emptiness.<br>
  &quot;You say do not know where the meaning lies. The nature of the meaning 
  is thus; how can you speak of its location?&quot;<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if you now wished there to be neither squareness nor roundness, 
  you would only need to take the container away. The substance of emptiness has 
  no shape, and so you should not say that you would also have to take the shape 
  away from the emptiness.<br>
  &quot;If, as you ask, your seeing shrinks and becomes small when you enter a 
  room, then when you look up at the sun is your seeing pulled out until it reaches 
  the sun's surface? If you build walls and eaves, which can press in and cut 
  off your seeing why then is there no evidence of a joining when you drill a 
  small hole? There fore, that idea is incorrect.<br>
  &quot;From beginningless time until now, all living beings have mistaken themselves 
  for things and, lost the original mind, are turned around by things. That is 
  why they contemplate bigness and smallness in the midst of all this.<br>
  &quot;If you can turn things around, then you are the same as the Thus Come 
  One.<br>
  &quot;With body and mind perfect and bright, you are an unmoving place of the 
  way.<br>
  &quot;The tip of a single fine hair can completely contain the lands of the 
  ten directions.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, if this seeing essence is 
  indeed my wonderful nature, my wonderful nature is now is front of me. If the 
  seeing is truly me, what, then, are my present body and mind? Yet it is my body 
  and mind, which make distinctions whereas the seeing does not make distinctions 
  and does not discern my body.<br>
  &quot;If it is really my mind which causes me to see now, when the seeing-nature 
  is actually me, and the body is not me.<br>
  &quot;How is this different from the question the Thus Come One asked about 
  things being able to see me? I only hope the Buddha will let fall his great 
  compassion and explain for those who have not yet awakened.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;What you have now said-that the seeing is in front 
  of you-is actually not the case.&quot;<br>
  &quot;If it were actually in front of you, it would be something you would actually 
  see, and then the seeing-essence would have a location. It wouldn't be that 
  there is no evidence of it.<br>
  &quot;Now as you sit in the Jeta Grove you look about everywhere at the grove, 
  the ponds, the halls, as far as the sun and moon, with the Ganges River before 
  you. Now, before my lion's seat, point out these various appearance: what is 
  dark is the groves, what is bright is the sun, what is obstructing is the walls, 
  what is clear is emptiness, and so on from the grasses and trees to the finest 
  particle of hair. Their sizes vary, and since they all have appearances, none 
  cannot be located.<br>
  &quot;If it is certain that your seeing is in front of you, then with your hand 
  you should with certainly point out what the seeing is. Ananda, if emptiness 
  is the seeing, then how can it remain empty since it has already become your 
  seeing? If a thing is the seeing, how can it be external to you as an object, 
  since it has already become your seeing?<br>
  &quot;You can cut through and peel away the myriad appearances to the finest 
  degree in order to distinguish and bring forth the essential brightness and 
  pure wonder of the source of seeing, pointing it out and showing it to me from 
  among all these things, so that it is perfectly clear beyond any doubt.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said. &quot; From where I am now in this many-storied lecture hall. As 
  far as the distant Ganges River and the sun and moon overhead, all that I might 
  raise my hand to point to, all that I indulge my eyes in seeing, are all things; 
  they are not the seeing. World Honored One, it is as the Buddha has said. Not 
  merely myself, who am a Shravaka of the first stage who still has outflows, 
  but even Bodhisattvas cannot break open and reveal, among the myriad appearance 
  which are before them, an essence of seeing which has a special self-nature 
  apart from all things.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;So it is, so it is.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said further to Ananda, &quot;It is as you have said. There is no 
  seeing-essence to be found existing separately among all the things. Therefore, 
  all the things you point to are things, and none is the seeing.<br>
  &quot;Now I will tell you: you and the Thus Come One sit in the Jeta Grove and 
  look again at the groves and gardens, as far as the sun and moon, and at all 
  the various different appearances, and it is certain that the seeing-essence 
  is not among whatever you point to. You can go ahead and reveal what, among 
  these things, is not your seeing.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;I see clearly all over this Jeta Grove, and I do not know 
  what in the midst of it is not my seeing.<br>
  &quot;Why? If trees are not the seeing, why do I see trees? If trees are the 
  seeing, then what becomes of trees? The same is true of everything up to and 
  including emptiness: if emptiness is not the seeing, why do I see emptiness? 
  If emptiness is the seeing, then what become of emptiness?<br>
  &quot;As I consider it again and reveal the subtlest aspects of the myriad appearances, 
  none is not my seeing.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;So it is, so it is.&quot;<br>
  Then all in the great assembly who had not reached the stage beyond study were 
  stunned upon hearing these words of the Buddha, and could not perceive where 
  the meaning began or ended. They were agitated and taken aback at the same time, 
  having lost what they had adhered to.<br>
  The Thus Come One, knowing they were anxious and uneasy in spirit, let pity 
  rise in his heart as he consoled Ananda and everyone in the great assembly. 
  &quot;Good people, what the Unsurpassed Dharma King says is true and real. He 
  speaks things as they are. He does not deceive. He does not lie. He is not Maskari 
  Goshaliputra with his four kinds of non-dying-deceptive and confusing theories. 
  You should consider this attentively. It is no disgrace to pity or to implore.&quot;<br>
  Then Manjushri, son of the Dharma king, took pity on the four assemblies, rose 
  from his seat in the midst of the great assembly, bowed at the Buddha's feet, 
  placed his palms together respectfully, and said to the Buddha, &quot;World 
  Honored One, the great assembly has not awakened to the Principle of the Thus 
  Come One's two-fold disclosure of the essence of seeing as being both form and 
  emptiness and as being neither of them.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, if the causal form, emptiness and other phenomena mentioned 
  above were the seeing, there should be an indication of its distance; and if 
  they were not the seeing, there should be nothing visible to be seen. Now we 
  do not know what is meant, and this is why we were alarmed and concerned.<br>
  It is not that our good roots from former lives are deficient. We only hope 
  the Thus Come One will have the great compassion to reveal exactly what all 
  the things are and what the seeing-essence is. Is it that there is no question 
  of 'is' or 'is not' in all of this?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Manjushri and the great assembly, &quot;To the Thus Come Ones 
  and the great Bodhisattvas of the ten directions, who dwell in this Samadhi, 
  seeing and the conditions of seeing, as well as the characteristics of thought, 
  are like flowers in space-fundamentally non-existent.<br>
  &quot;This seeing and its conditions are originally the wonderful pure bright 
  substance of Bodhi. How can speak of 'is' and 'is not'?<br>
  &quot;Manjushri, I now ask you: take yourself as an example, Manjushri. Is there 
  still another Manjushri? Is there a Manjushri who is and a Manjushri who is 
  not?&quot;<br>
  &quot;So it is, World Honored One: I am truly Manjushri. There is no Manjushri 
  who 'is.' Why? If there were still another Manjushri who 'is' Manjushri, there 
  would be two Manjushris. But it is not that now I am not Manjushri. In fact, 
  neither of the two characteristics 'is' and 'is not' exist.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;This is not only the case with the seeing, the basic 
  substance of wonderful Bodhi, but also with emptiness and mundane objects.<br>
  &quot;They are basically the projections or manifestations of the wonderful 
  brightness of unsurpassed Bodhi, the pure, perfect, true mind. They are falsely 
  taken to be form and emptiness, as well as hearing and seeing.<br>
  &quot;Just as with the second moon: which one 'is' the moon and which 'is not' 
  the moon? Manjushri, there is only one true moon, and within it there is not 
  a moon that 'is' or a moon that 'is not.'<br>
  &quot;Therefore, now as you contemplate the seeing and the mundane things together, 
  all the things you disclose are called false thoughts. You cannot transcend 
  'is' and 'is not' form within them.<br>
  &quot;With the true essence, the wonderful enlightened bright nature, you can 
  get beyond trying to point out or not point out.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, it is truly as the Dharma 
  King has said: the condition of enlightenment pervades the ten directions, clear 
  everlasting and by nature neither produced nor extinguished. How does it differ, 
  then, from the first Brahma Kapila's teaching of the profound truth or from 
  the teaching of the ascetics who throw ashes on themselves of from the other 
  sects outside the way that say there is a true self which pervades the ten directions?<br>
  &quot;Also, in the past, the World Honored One gave a lecture on Mount Lanka 
  explaining the principle thoroughly for the sake of great wisdom Bodhisattva 
  and others: 'Those sects outside the way always speak of spontaneity. I speak 
  of causes and conditions which is an entirely different principle.'<br>
  &quot;Now as I contemplate the nature of enlightenment as spontaneous, as neither 
  produced nor extinguished, and as apart from all empty falseness and inversion, 
  it seems to have nothing to do with your causes and conditions or the spontaneity 
  advocated by others. Would you please enlighten us on this point lest we should 
  fall into deviant paths, thus enabling us to obtain the true mind, the bright 
  nature of wonderful enlightenment?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;Now I have instructed you with such expedients 
  in order to tell you the truth, yet you do not awaken to it but mistake it for 
  spontaneity.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if it definitely were spontaneous, you should be able to distinguish 
  the substance of the spontaneity.<br>
  &quot;Now you look into the wonderful bright seeing. What is its self? Does 
  the seeing take bright light as its self? Does it take darkness as its self? 
  Does it take emptiness as its self? Does it take solid objects as its self?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if its self consists in light, you should not see darkness. Moreover, 
  if it takes emptiness as the substance of its self, you should not see solid 
  objects. Continuing in the same way, if it takes all dark appearances as its 
  self, then when it is light, the seeing-nature is cut off and extinguished, 
  and how can you see light?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;I am certain that the nature of this wonderful seeing is 
  not spontaneous. Now I discern that it is produced from causes and conditions. 
  But I do not yet have it clear in my mind. I now ask the Thus Come One how this 
  idea is consonant with the nature of causes and conditions.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;You say it is causes and conditions. I ask you again: 
  because you are now seeing, the seeing-nature manifests. Is it because of light 
  that the seeing exists? Is it because of darkness that the seeing exists? Is 
  it because of emptiness that the seeing exists? Is it because of solid objects 
  that the seeing exists?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if light brings it into existence , you should not see darkness 
  and if it exists because of darkness, you should not see light: it is the same 
  with emptiness and solid objects.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, does the seeing derive from the condition of light? 
  Does the seeing derive from the condition of darkness? Does the seeing derive 
  from the condition of emptiness? Does the seeing derive from the condition from 
  the condition of solid objects?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if it exists because of the condition of emptiness, you should 
  not see solid objects. If it exists because of the condition of solid objects, 
  you should not see emptiness: it is the same with light and darkness.<br>
  &quot;Thus you should know that the essential, enlightened wonderful brightness 
  is due to neither causes nor conditions and it does not arise spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;It is not that which is not spontaneous. It is not that it is not; nor 
  is it that it is not not. It is not that which 'is' or 'is not.'<br>
  &quot;All Dharma is that which is apart from all characteristics.<br>
  &quot;Now in the midst of them, how can you use your mind to make distinctions 
  that are based on worldly sophistries, terms, and characteristics? That is like 
  grasping at empty space with your hand: you only succeed in tiring yourself 
  out. How could empty space possibly yield to your grasp?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;If the nature of the wonderful enlightenment 
  has neither causes nor conditions, then why does the World Honored One always 
  tell the Bhikshus that the nature of seeing derives from the four conditions 
  of emptiness, brightness, the mind, and the eyes? What does that mean?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Ananda, what I have said about all the worldly causes 
  and conditions has nothing to do with the primary meaning.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, I ask you again: people in the world say, 'I can see.' What is 
  meant by seeing? What is not seeing?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;Due to the light of the sun, the moon, and lamps, people 
  in the world can see all kinds of appearances: that is called seeing. If it 
  were not for these kinds of light, they would not be able to see.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if it is called 'not seeing' when there is no light, you should 
  not see darkness. If in fact you do see darkness, which is none other than the 
  lack of light, how can you say there is an absence of seeing?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if, when it is dark, you call it 'not seeing' because you do not 
  see light, then since it is now light and you do not see the characteristics 
  of darkness, it should also be called 'not seeing.' Thus, the two characteristics 
  would both be called 'not seeing.'&quot;<br>
  &quot;Although these two characteristics replace one another, your seeing-nature 
  does not lapse for an instant. Thus you can know that there is seeing in both 
  cases. Now, then, can you say there is no seeing?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, Ananda, you should know that when you see light, the seeing 
  is not the light. When you see darkness, the seeing is not the darkness. When 
  you see emptiness, the seeing is not the emptiness. When you see solid objects, 
  the seeing is not the solid objects.<br>
  &quot;Having realized these four meanings, you should also know that when you 
  see your seeing, the seeing is not the seeing to be seen. Since the former seeing 
  is beyond the latter, the latter cannot reach it. Such being the case, how can 
  you say that your absolute intuitive perception has something to do with causes 
  and conditions or spontaneity or that it has something to do with mixing and 
  uniting?<br>
  &quot;You narrow-minded sound hearers are so inferior and ignorant that you 
  are unable to penetrate through to the purity of the characteristics of reality. 
  Now I will teach you. You should consider it well, and do not become weary or 
  negligent on the wonderful road to Bodhi.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, it is still not clear in 
  my mind what the Buddha, the World Honored One, has explained for me and for 
  others like me about causes and conditions, spontaneity, the characteristics 
  of mixing and uniting, and the absence of mixing and uniting. And now to hear 
  further that to see seeing is not seeing adds yet another layer of confusion.<br>
  &quot;Humbly, I hope that with your vast compassion you will bestow upon us 
  the great wisdom-eye so as to show us the bright pure enlightened mind.&quot; 
  After saying this he wept, made obeisance, and waited to receive the holy instruction.<br>
  Then the World Honored One, out of pity for Ananda and the great assembly, began 
  to explain extensively the wonderful path of cultivation of all Samadhis of 
  the great Dharani.<br>
  And said to Ananda, &quot;Although you have a strong memory, it only benefits 
  your wide learning. But your mind has not yet understood the subtle secret contemplation 
  and illumination of Shamatha. Listen attentively now as I explain it for you 
  in detail.<br>
  &quot;And cause all those of the future who have outflows to obtain the fruition 
  of Bodhi.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, all living beings turn on the wheel in this world because of two 
  upside-down discriminating false views. Wherever these views arise, there is 
  revolution through the cycle of appropriate Karma.<br>
  &quot;What are the two views? The first consists of the false view based on 
  living beings' individual Karma. The second consists of the false view based 
  on living beings' collective share.<br>
  &quot;What is meant by false views based on individual Karma? Ananda, it is 
  like a man in the world who has red cataracts on his eyes so that at night he 
  alone sees around the lamp a circular reflection composed of layers of five 
  colors.<br>
  &quot;What do you think? Is the circle of light that appears around the lamp 
  at night the lamp's colors, or is it the seeing's colors?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if it is the lamp's colors, why is it that someone without the 
  disease does not see the same thing, and only the one who is diseased sees the 
  circular reflection? If it is the seeing's colors, then the seeing has already 
  become colored; what, then, is the circular reflection the diseased man sees 
  to be called?<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, if the circular reflection is in itself a thing apart 
  from the lamp, then it would be seen around the folding screen, the curtain, 
  the table, and the mats. If it has nothing to do with the seeing, it should 
  not be seen by the eyes. Why is it that the man with cataracts sees the circular 
  reflections with his eyes?&quot;<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that in fact the colors come from the lamp, 
  and the diseased seeing brings about the reflection. Both the circular reflection 
  and the faulty seeing are the result of the cataract. But that which sees the 
  diseased film is not sick. Thus you should not say that it is the lamp or the 
  seeing or that it is neither the lamp nor the seeing.<br>
  &quot;It is like a second moon often seen when one presses on one's eye while 
  looking up into the sky. It is neither substantial nor a reflection because 
  it is an illusory vision caused by the pressure exerted on one's eye. Hence, 
  a wise person should not say that the second moon is a form or not a form. Not 
  is it correct to say that the illusory second moon is apart from the seeing 
  or not apart from the seeing.<br>
  &quot;It is the same with the illusion created by the diseased eyes. You cannot 
  say it is from the lamp or from the seeing: even less can it be said not to 
  be from the lamp or the seeing.<br>
  &quot;What is meant by the false view of the collective share? Ananda, in Jambudvipa, 
  besides the waters of the great seas, there is level land that forms some three 
  thousand continents. East and west, throughout the entire expanse of the great 
  continent, there are twenty-three hundred large countries. In the other, smaller 
  continents in the seas there may be two or three hundred countries, or perhaps 
  one or two, or perhaps thirty, forty, or fifty.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, suppose that among them there is one small continent where there 
  are only two countries. The people of just one of the countries together experience 
  evil conditions. On that small continent, all the people of that country see 
  all kinds of inauspicious things: perhaps they see two suns, perhaps they see 
  two moons with circles, or a dark haze, or girdle-ornaments around them; or 
  comets, shooting stars, 'ears' on the sun or moon, rainbows, secondary rainbows, 
  and various other evil signs.<br>
  &quot;Only the people in that country see them. The living beings in the other 
  country from the first do not see or hear anything unusual.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, I will now go back and forth comparing these two matters for you, 
  to make both of them clear.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, in the case of the living being's false view of individual Karma 
  by which he sees the appearance of a circular reflection around the lamp, the 
  appearance seems to be a state, but in the end, what is seen comes into being 
  because of the cataracts on the eyes.<br>
  &quot;The cataracts are the result of the weariness of the seeing rather than 
  the products of form. However, the essence of seeing which perceives the cataracts 
  is free from all diseases and defects. For example, you now see your eyes to 
  look at the mountains, the rivers, the countries, and all the living beings: 
  and they are all brought about by the disease of your seeing contracted since 
  time without beginning.<br>
  &quot;Seeing and the conditions of seeing seem to manifest what is before you. 
  Originally my enlightenment is bright. The seeing and conditions arise from 
  the cataracts. Realize that the seeing arises from the cataracts: the enlightened 
  condition of the basically enlightened bright mind has no cataracts.<br>
  &quot;That which is aware of the faulty awareness is not diseased. It is the 
  true perception of seeing. How can you continue to speak of feeling, hearing, 
  knowing, and seeing?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you now see me and yourself and the world and all the ten kinds 
  of living beings because of a disease in the seeing. What is aware of the disease 
  is not diseased.<br>
  &quot;The true essential seeing by nature has no disease. Therefore it is not 
  called seeing.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, let us compare the false views of those living beings' collective 
  share with the false views of the individual Karma of one person.<br>
  &quot;The individual man with the diseased eyes is the same as the people of 
  that one country. He sees circular reflection erroneously brought about by a 
  disease of the seeing. The beings with a collective share see inauspicious things. 
  In the midst of their Karma of identical views arise pestilence and evils.<br>
  &quot;Both are produced from a beginningless falsity in the seeing. It is the 
  same in the three thousand continents of Jambudvipa, throughout the four great 
  seas and in the Saha world and throughout the ten directions. All countries 
  that have outflows and all living beings are the enlightened bright wonderful 
  mind without outflows. Because of the false, diseased conditions that are seen, 
  heard, felt, and known, they mix and unite in false birth, mix and unite in 
  false death.<br>
  &quot;If you can leave far behind all conditions which mix and unite and those 
  which do not mix and unite, then you can also extinguish and cast out the causes 
  of birth and death, and obtain perfect Bodhi, the nature which is neither produced 
  nor extinguished. It is the pure clear basic mind, the everlasting fundamental 
  enlightenment.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, although you have already realized that the wonderfully bright 
  basic enlightenment does not by nature come from causes and conditions and is 
  not by nature spontaneous, you have not yet understood that the enlightened 
  source is produced neither from mixing and uniting nor from a lack of mixing 
  and uniting.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, now I will once again make use of the mundane objects before you 
  to question you. You now hold that false thoughts mix and unite with the causes 
  and conditions of everything in the world, and you wonder whether certification 
  to Bodhi might arise from mixing and uniting.<br>
  Accordingly, right now, does the wonderful pure seeing-essence mix with light, 
  does it mix with darkness, does it mix with penetration or does it mix with 
  obstructions? If it mixed with light, look further at the light: what place 
  there in the light before you are combined with the seeing? If you can distinguish 
  the characteristic of seeing, what does it look like in combination?<br>
  &quot;If it is not the seeing, how can you see the light? If it is the seeing, 
  how can the seeing see itself?<br>
  &quot;If it is certain that the seeing is complete, what room will there be 
  for it to mix with the light? If the light is complete, it cannot unite and 
  mix with the seeing.<br>
  &quot;If seeing is different from light, then both the nature and the light 
  lose their identity when they combine. Since the combination results in the 
  loss of the light and the nature, it is meaningless to say it mixes with light. 
  The same principle applies to its mixing with darkness, with penetration, or 
  with all forms of obstruction.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, as you are right now, once again, does the wonderful 
  pure seeing-essence unite with light, does it unite with darkness, does it unite 
  with penetration, or does it unite with obstructions?<br>
  &quot;If it unites with light, then when darkness comes the characteristic of 
  light is extinguished, how will you be able to see darkness, since the seeing 
  does not unite with darkness? If you do see darkness and yet at that time there 
  is no union. With darkness, but rather a union with light, then you would not 
  have seen light. Since you would not have seen light, why is it that, when there 
  is union with light, you are able to know clearly that it is light and not darkness?<br>
  &quot;The same is true of its union with darkness, with penetration, or with 
  any kind of obstruction.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, as I consider it, the source 
  of this wonderful enlightenment does not mix or unite with any conditioned mundane 
  object or with the mind's speculation. Is that the case?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Now you say further that the enlightened nature is neither 
  mixed nor united. So now I ask you further: as to this wonderful seeing-essence's 
  neither mixing nor uniting, does it not mix with light? Does it not mix with 
  darkness? Does it not mix with penetration? Does it not mix with obstructions?<br>
  &quot;If it does not mix with light, then between seeing and light there must 
  be a boundary.<br>
  &quot;Examine it further: what place is light? What place is seeing? Where are 
  the boundaries of the seeing and the light?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if there is no seeing within the boundaries of light, then there 
  is no contact between them, and clearly one would not know where the characteristic 
  of light is. Then how could its boundaries be realized?<br>
  &quot;As to its not mixing with darkness, with penetration, or with any kind 
  of obstruction, the principle is the same.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, as to the wonderful seeing-essence's neither mixing nor uniting, 
  does it not unite with light? Does it not unite with darkness? Does it not unite 
  with penetration? Does it not unite with obstructions?<br>
  &quot;If it does not unite with light, then the seeing and the light are at 
  odds with each other by nature, as are the ear and the light, which do not come 
  in contact.<br>
  &quot;Since the seeing does not know where the characteristic of light is, how 
  can it determine clearly whether there is union?&quot;<br>
  &quot;As to its not uniting with darkness, with penetrations, or with any kind 
  of obstruction, the principle is the same.&quot;</b></p>

  VOLUME 3<br></b>
  &quot;Ananda, you have not yet understood that all the defiling objects that 
  appear, all the illusory, ephemeral characteristics, spring up in the very spot 
  where they also come to an end. They are what is called 'illusory falseness.' 
  But their nature is in truth the bright substance of wonderful enlightenment.<br>
  &quot;Thus it is throughout, up to the five Skandhas and the six entrances, 
  to the twelve places and the eighteen realms; the union and mixture of various 
  causes and conditions account for their illusory and false existence, and the 
  separation and dispersion of the causes and conditions result in their illusory 
  and false extinction.<br>
  &quot;Who would have thought that production, extinction, coming, and going 
  are fundamentally the everlasting, wonderful light of the treasury of the Thus 
  Come One, the unmoving, all-pervading perfection, the wonderful nature of True 
  Suchness! If within the true and permanent nature one seeks coming and going, 
  confusion and enlightenment, or birth and death, there is nothing that can be 
  obtained.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, why do I say that the five Skandhas are basically the wonderful 
  nature of True Suchness, the treasury of the Thus Come One?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, consider this example: when a person who has pure clear eyes looks 
  at clear, bright emptiness, he sees nothing but clear emptiness, and he is quite 
  certain that nothing exists within it.<br>
  &quot;If, for no apparent reason, the person does not move his eyes, the staring 
  will cause fatigue, and then of his own accord, he will see strange flowers 
  in space and other unreal appearances that are wild and disordered.<br>
  &quot;You should know it is the same with the Skandha of form.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, the strange flowers come neither from emptiness nor from the eyes.<br>
  &quot;The reason for this, Ananda, is that if the flowers were to come from 
  emptiness, they would return to emptiness. If there is a coming out and a going 
  in, the space would not be empty. Then it could not contain the appearance of 
  the arisal and extinction of the flowers, just as Ananda's body cannot contain 
  another Ananda.<br>
  &quot;If the flowers were to come from the eyes, they would return to the eyes.<br>
  &quot;If the nature of the flowers were to come from the eyes, it would be endowed 
  with the faculty of seeing. If it could see, then when it left the eyes it would 
  become flowers in space, and when it returned it should see the eyes. If it 
  did not see, then when it left the eyes it would obscure emptiness, and it returned, 
  it would obscure the eyes.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, when you see the flowers, your eyes should not be obscured. 
  So why is it that the eyes are said to be 'pure and bright' when they see clear 
  emptiness?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that the Skandha of from is empty and false, 
  because it neither depends on causes and conditions for existence nor is spontaneous 
  in nature.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, consider the example of a person whose hands and feet are relaxed 
  and at ease and whose entire body is in balance and harmony. He is unaware of 
  his life-processes, because there is nothing agreeable or disagreeable in his 
  nature. However, for some unknown reason, the person rubs his two hands together 
  in emptiness, and sensations of roughness, smoothness, cold, and warmth seem 
  to arise from nowhere between his palms.<br>
  &quot;You should know that it is the same with the Skandha of feeling.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, all this illusory contact does not come from emptiness, nor does 
  it come from the hand.<br>
  &quot;The reason for this, Ananda, is that if it came from emptiness, then since 
  it could make contact with the palms, why wouldn't it make contact with the 
  body? It should not be that emptiness chooses what it comes in contact with.<br>
  &quot;If it came from the palms, it could be readily felt without waiting for 
  the two palms to be joined.<br>
  &quot;What is more, if it were to come from the palms, then the palms would 
  know when they were joined. When they separated, the contact would return into 
  the arms, the wrists, the bones, and the marrow, and you also should be aware 
  of the course of its entry.<br>
  &quot;It should also be perceived by the mind because it would behave like something 
  coming in and going out of the body. In that case, what need would there be 
  to put the two palms together to experience what is called 'contact?'<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that the Skandha of feeling is empty and false, 
  because it neither depends on causes and conditions for existence nor is spontaneous 
  in nature.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, consider the example of a person whose mouth waters at the mention 
  of sour plums, or the soles of whose feet tingle when he thinks about walking 
  along a precipice.<br>
  &quot;You should know that it is the same with the Skandha of thinking.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, you should know that the watering of the mouth caused by the mention 
  of the plums does not come from the plums, nor does it come from the mouth.<br>
  &quot;The reason for this, Ananda, is that if it were produced from the plums, 
  the plums should speak for themselves, why wait for someone to mention them? 
  If it came from the mouth, the mouth itself should hear, and what need would 
  there be to wait for the ear? If the ear alone heard, then why doesn't the water 
  come out of the ear?<br>
  &quot;Thinking about walking along a precipice is explained in the same way.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that the Skandha of thinking is empty and false, 
  since it neither depends upon causes and conditions for existence, nor is spontaneous 
  in nature.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, consider, for example, a swift rapids whose waves follow upon 
  one another in orderly succession, the ones behind never overtaking the ones 
  in front.<br>
  &quot;You should know that it is the same with the Skandha of activity.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, thus the nature of the flow does not arise because of emptiness, 
  nor does it come into existence because of the water. It is not the nature of 
  water, and yet it is not separate from either emptiness or water.<br>
  &quot;The reason for this, Ananda, is that if it arose because of emptiness, 
  then the inexhaustible emptiness throughout the ten directions would become 
  an inexhaustible flow, and all the worlds would inevitably be drowned.<br>
  &quot;If the swift rapids existed because of water, then their nature would 
  differ from that of water and the location and characteristics of its existence 
  would be apparent.<br>
  &quot;If their nature were simply that of water, then when they become still 
  and clear they would no longer be made up of water.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it were to separate from emptiness and water: there isn't anything 
  outside of emptiness, and outside of water there isn't any flow.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that the Skandha of activity is empty and false, 
  since it neither depends upon causes and conditions of existence nor is spontaneous 
  in nature.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, consider, for example, a man who picks up a Kalavinka pitcher 
  and stops up its two holes. He lifts up the pitcher filled with emptiness and, 
  walking some thousand Li (about one third of a mile) away, presents it to another 
  country. You should know that the Skandha of consciousness is the same way.<br>
  &quot;Thus, Ananda, the space does not come from one place, nor does it go to 
  another.<br>
  &quot;The reason for this, Ananda, is that if it were to come from another place, 
  then when the stored-up emptiness in the pitcher went elsewhere there would 
  be less emptiness in the place where the pitcher was originally.<br>
  &quot;If it were to enter this region: when the holes were unplugged and the 
  pitcher was turned over, one would see emptiness come out.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that the Skandha of consciousness is empty 
  and false, since it neither depends upon causes and conditions for existence 
  nor is spontaneous in nature.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, why do I say that the six entrances have their origin 
  in the wonderful nature of True Suchness, the treasury of the Thus Come One?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, although the eye's staring causes fatigue, the eye and the fatigue 
  originate in Bodhi. Staring gives rise to the characteristics of fatigue.<br>
  &quot;Because a sense of seeing is stimulated in the midst of the two false, 
  defiling objects of light and dark, defiling appearances are taken in; this 
  is called the nature of seeing. Apart from the two defiling objects of light 
  and dark, this seeing is ultimately without substance.<br>
  &quot;Thus, Ananda, you should know that seeing does not come from light or 
  dark, nor does it come forth from the sense organ, nor is it produced from emptiness.<br>
  &quot;Why? If it came from light, then it would be extinguished when it is dark, 
  and you would not see darkness. If it came from darkness, then it would be extinguished 
  when it is light, and you would not see light.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came from the sense-organ, which is obviously devoid of light 
  and dark: a nature of seeing such as this would have no self-nature.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came forth from emptiness. When it looks in front of you, it 
  sees the shapes of the defiling dust; turning around, it would see your sense 
  organ. Moreover, if it were emptiness itself which sees, what connection would 
  that have with your entrance?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that the eye entrance is empty and false, since 
  it neither depends upon causes and conditions for existence nor is spontaneous 
  in nature.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, consider, for example, a person who suddenly stops up his ears 
  with two fingers. Because the sense-organ of hearing has become fatigued, a 
  sound is heard in his head. However, both the ears and the fatigue originate 
  in Bodhi. Monotony will produce the characteristics of fatigue.<br>
  &quot;Because a sense of hearing is stimulated in the midst of the two false, 
  defiling objects of movement and stillness, defiling appearances are taken in; 
  this is called the nature of hearing. Apart from the two defiling objects of 
  movement and stillness, this hearing is ultimately without substance.<br>
  &quot;Thus, Ananda, you should know that hearing does not come from movement 
  and stillness; nor does it come from the sense organ, nor is it produced from 
  emptiness.<br>
  &quot;Why? If it came from stillness, it would be extinguished when there is 
  movement, and you would not hear movement. If it came from movement, then it 
  would be extinguished when there is stillness, and you would not be aware of 
  the stillness.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came from the sense-organ, which is obviously devoid of movement 
  and stillness: a nature of hearing such as this would have no self-nature.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came from emptiness: emptiness would then become hearing and 
  would no longer be emptiness. Moreover, if it were emptiness itself which hears, 
  what connection would it have with your entrance?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that the ear-entrance is empty and false, since 
  it neither depends upon causes and conditions for existence, nor is spontaneous 
  in nature.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, consider, for example, a person who inhales deeply through his 
  nose. After he has inhaled for a long time it becomes fatigued, and then there 
  is a sensation of cold in the nose. Because of that sensation, there are the 
  distinctions of penetration and obstruction, of emptiness and actuality, and 
  so forth, including all fragrant and stinking vapors. However, both the nose 
  and the fatigue originate in Bodhi. Over-exertion will produce the characteristic 
  of fatigue.<br>
  &quot;Because a sense of smelling is stimulated in the midst of the two false, 
  defiling objects of penetration and obstruction, defiling appearances are taken 
  in; this is called the nature of smelling. Apart from the two defiling objects 
  of penetration and obstruction, this smelling is ultimately without substance.<br>
  &quot;You should know that smelling does not come from penetration and obstruction, 
  nor does it come forth from the sense organ, nor is it produced from emptiness.<br>
  &quot;Why? If it came from penetration, the smelling would be extinguished when 
  there is obstruction, and then how could it experience obstruction? If it existed 
  because of obstruction, then where there is penetration there would be no smelling; 
  in that case, how would the awareness of fragrance, stench, and other such sensations 
  come into being?<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came from the sense organ, which is obviously devoid of penetration 
  and obstruction. A nature of smelling such as this would have no self-nature.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came from emptiness: smelling itself would turn around and 
  smell your own nose. Moreover, if it were emptiness itself which smelled, what 
  connection would it have with your entrance?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that the nose-entrance is empty and false, 
  since it neither depends upon causes and conditions for existence nor is spontaneous 
  in nature.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, consider, for example, a person who licks his lips with his tongue. 
  His excessive licking causes fatigue. If the person is sick, there will be a 
  bitter flavor; a person who is not sick will have a subtle sweet sensation. 
  Sweetness and bitterness demonstrate the tongue's sense of taste. When the organ 
  is inactive, a sense of tastelessness prevails. However, both the tongue and 
  the fatigue originate in Bodhi. Stress produces the characteristic of fatigue.<br>
  &quot;Because the two defiling objects of sweetness and bitterness, as well 
  as tastelessness, stimulate a recognition of taste which in turn draws in these 
  defiling sensations, it becomes what is known as a sense of taste. Apart from 
  the two defiling objects of sweetness and bitterness and apart from tastelessness, 
  the sense of taste is originally without a substance.<br>
  &quot;Thus, Ananda, you should know that the perception of sweetness, bitterness, 
  and tastelessness does not come from sweetness or bitterness, nor does it exist 
  because of tastelessness, nor does it arise from the sense organ, nor is it 
  produced from emptiness.<br>
  &quot;For what reason? If it came from sweetness and bitterness, it would cease 
  to exist when tastelessness was experienced, so how could it recognize tastelessness? 
  If it arose from tastelessness, it would vanish when the flavor of sweetness 
  was tasted, so how could it perceive the two flavors, sweet and bitter?<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came from the tongue which is obviously devoid of the defiling 
  objects of sweetness and bitterness and of tastelessness. An essence of tasting 
  such as this would have no self-nature.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came from emptiness: the sense of taste would be experienced 
  by emptiness instead of by the mouth. Suppose, moreover, that it was emptiness 
  itself which tasted; what connection would that have with you entrance?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that the tongue entrance is empty and false 
  since it neither depends upon causes and conditions for existence nor it is 
  spontaneous in nature.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, consider, for example, a person who touches his warm hand with 
  his cold hand. If the cold is in excess of the warmth, the warm hand will become 
  cold; if the warmth is in excess of the cold, his cold hand will become warm. 
  So the sensation of warmth and cold is felt through the contact and separation 
  of the two hands. Fatiguing contact results in the interpenetration of warmth 
  and cold. However, both body and the fatigue originate in Bodhi. Protraction 
  produces the characteristic of fatigue.<br>
  &quot;Because a physical sensation is stimulated in the midst of the two defiling 
  objects of separation and union, defiling appearances are taken in; this is 
  called the awareness of sensation. Apart from the two sets of defiling objects 
  of separation and union, and pleasantness and unpleasantness, the awareness 
  of sensation is originally without a substance.<br>
  &quot;Thus, Ananda, you should know that this sensation does not come from separation 
  and union, nor does it exist because of pleasantness and unpleasantness, nor 
  does it arise from the sense organ, nor is it produced from emptiness.<br>
  &quot;For what reason? If it arose when there was union, it would disappear 
  when there was separation, so how could it sense the separation? The two characteristics 
  of pleasantness and unpleasantness are the same way.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came from the sense organ, which is obviously devoid of the 
  four characteristics of union, separation, pleasantness, and unpleasantness; 
  and awareness of physical sensation such as this would have no self-nature.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came from emptiness; the awareness of sensations would be experienced 
  by emptiness itself, what connection would that have with your entrance?<br>
  &quot;Therefore you should know that the body-entrance is empty and false, since 
  it neither depends upon causes and conditions for existence, nor is spontaneous 
  in nature.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, consider, for example, a person who becomes so fatigued that he 
  goes to sleep. Having slept soundly, he awakens and tries to recollect what 
  he experienced while asleep. He recalls some things and forgets others. Thus, 
  his upsidedownness goes through production, dwelling, change, and extinction, 
  which are taken in and returned to a center habitually, each following the next 
  without ever being overtaken. This is known as the mind organ or intellect. 
  The mind and the fatigue are both Bodhi. Persistence produces the characteristic 
  of fatigue.<br>
  &quot;The two defiling objects of production and extinction stimulate a sense 
  of knowing which in turn grasps these inner sense data, reversing the flow of 
  seeing and hearing before the flow reaches the ground it is known as the faculty 
  of intellect.<br>
  &quot;Apart from the two sets of defiling objects of waking and sleeping and 
  of production and extinction, the faculty of intellect is originally without 
  substance.<br>
  &quot;Thus, Ananda, you should know that the faculty of intellect does not come 
  from waking, sleeping, production, or extinction, nor does it arise from the 
  sense organ, nor is it produced from emptiness.<br>
  &quot;For what reason? If it came from waking, it would disappear at the time 
  of sleeping, so how could it experience sleep? If it came from production, it 
  would cease to exist at the time of extinction, so how could it undergo extinction? 
  If it came from extinction it would disappear at the time of production, so 
  how could it know about production?<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came from the sense-organ; waking and sleeping cause only a 
  physical opening and closing respectively. Apart from these two movements, the 
  faculty of intellect is as unsubstantial as flowers in space, because it is 
  fundamentally without a self-nature.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it came from emptiness; the sense of intellect would be experienced 
  by emptiness instead of by the mind. Then what connection would that have with 
  your entrance?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that the mind entrance is empty and false, 
  since it neither depends upon causes and conditions for existence nor is spontaneous 
  in nature.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, why do I say that the twelve places are basically the 
  wonderful nature of True Suchness, the treasury of the Thus Come One?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, look again at the trees in the Jeta Grove and the fountains and 
  pools. <br>
  &quot;What do you think? Do these things come into being because the forms are 
  produced and thus the eyes see, or because the eyes produce the characteristics 
  of form?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if the organ of sight were to produce the characteristics of form, 
  then the nature of form would be obliterated when you see emptiness, which is 
  not from. Once it was obliterated, everything that is manifest would disappear. 
  Since the characteristics of form would then be absent, who would be able to 
  understand the nature of emptiness? The same is true of emptiness.<br>
  &quot;If, moreover, the defiling objects of form were to produce the eye's seeing, 
  then seeing would perish upon looking at emptiness, which is not form, and once 
  it perished, everything would disappear. Then who would be able to understand 
  emptiness and form?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that neither seeing nor form nor emptiness 
  has a location, and thus the two places of form and seeing are empty and false. 
  Their origin is not in causes and conditions, nor do their natures arise spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, listen again to the drum being beaten in the Jeta Grove when the 
  food is ready. The assembly gathers as the bell is struck. The sounds of the 
  bell and the drum follow one another in succession.<br>
  &quot;What do you think? Do these things come into existence because the sound 
  comes of the region of the ear, or because the ear goes to the place of the 
  sound?<br>
  &quot;Again, Ananda, suppose that the sound comes to the region of the ear. 
  Similarly, when I go to beg for food in the city of Shravasti, I am no longer 
  in the Jeta Grove. If the sound definitely goes to the region of Ananda's ear, 
  then neither Maudgalyayana nor Kashyapa would hear it, and even less the twelve 
  hundred and fifty Shramanas who, upon hearing the sound of the bell, come to 
  the dining hall at the same time.<br>
  &quot;Again, suppose that the ear goes to the region of the sound. Similarly, 
  when I return to the Jeta Grove, I am no longer in the city of Shravasti. When 
  you hear the sound of the drum, your ear will already have gone to the place 
  where the drum is being beaten. Thus, when the bell peals, you will not hear 
  the sound-even the less that of the elephants, horses, cows, sheep, and all 
  the other various sounds around you.<br>
  &quot;If there is no coming or going, there will be no hearing, either.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that neither hearing nor sound has a location, 
  and thus the two places of hearing and sound are empty and false. Their origin 
  is not in causes and conditions, nor do their natures arise spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, you smell the Chandana in this censer. When one particle 
  of this incense is lit, it can be smelled simultaneously through forty Li around 
  the city of Shravasti.<br>
  &quot;What do you think? Is this fragrance produced from the Chandana wood? 
  Is it produced in your nose, or does it arise within emptiness?<br>
  &quot;Again, Ananda, suppose this fragrance is produced from your nose. What 
  is said to be produced from the nose should come forth from the nose. Your nose 
  is not Chandana, so how can the nose have the fragrance of Chandana? When you 
  say you smell fragrance, it should enter your nose. For the nose to emit fragrance 
  is not the meaning of smelling.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it is produced from within emptiness. The nature of emptiness 
  is everlasting and unchanging, and so the fragrance should be eternally present. 
  What need should there be to rely on burning the dry wood in the censer?<br>
  &quot;Suppose it is produced from the wood. Now, the nature of this incense 
  is such that it gives off smoke when it is burned. If the nose smells it, it 
  should be filled with smoke. The smoke rises into the air, and before it has 
  reached the distance, how is it that the fragrance is already being smelled 
  at a distance of forty Li?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that neither the fragrance, nor the nose's 
  smelling has a location, and so the two places of smelling and fragrance are 
  empty and false. Their origin is not in causes and conditions, nor do their 
  natures arise spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, twice every day you take up your bowl along with the rest of the 
  assembly, and among what you receive may be things of supreme flavor, such as 
  curds, buttermilk, and clarified butter.<br>
  &quot;What do you think? Are these flavors produced from emptiness, do they 
  forth from the tongue, or are they produced from the food?<br>
  &quot;Again, Ananda, suppose that the flavors came form your tongue; now there 
  is only one tongue in your mouth. When that tongue had already become the flavor 
  of curds, then it would not change if it encountered some dark rock- candy.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it did not change: that would not be what is called knowing tastes. 
  Suppose it did change: the tongue is not many substances, and how could one 
  tongue know so many tastes?<br>
  &quot;Suppose it were produced from the food. The food does not have consciousness; 
  how could it know tastes? Moreover, if the food itself were to recognize them, 
  that would be the same as someone else eating. Then what connection would that 
  have with what is called your recognition of tastes?<br>
  &quot;Suppose it were produced in emptiness. When you eat emptiness, what flavor 
  does it have? Suppose that emptiness had the flavor of salt. Then, since your 
  tongue was salty, your face would also be salty, and likewise everyone in the 
  world would be like fish in the sea. Since you would be constantly influenced 
  by salt, you would never know tastelessness. If you did not recognize tastelessness, 
  you would not be aware of the saltiness, either. You would not know anything 
  at all. How could that be what is called taste?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that neither flavors nor the tongue's tasting 
  has a location; and, so the two places of tasting and flavor are empty and false. 
  Their origin is not in causes and conditions, nor do their natures arise spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, early every morning you rub your head with your hand.<br>
  &quot;What do you think? When there is a sensation of the rubbing, where does 
  the ability to make contact lie? Is the ability to make contact lie? Is the 
  ability in the hands or is it in the head?<br>
  &quot;If it were in the hands, then the head would have no knowledge of it, 
  and how could that be what is called touch? If it were in the head, then the 
  hands would be useless, and how could that be what is called touch? <br>
  &quot;If each had it, then you, Ananda, would have two bodies.<br>
  &quot;If there were only one touch in the head and the hand, then the hand and 
  the head would be of one substance. If they were one substance, then no touch 
  would be possible.<br>
  &quot;If they were two substances, to which would the touch belong? The one 
  which was capable of touching would not be the one that was touched. The one 
  that was touched would not be that the touch came into being between you and 
  emptiness.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that neither the sensation of touch nor the 
  body has a location. And so the two places of the body and touch are empty and 
  false. Their origin is not in causes and conditions, nor no their natures arise 
  spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, your mind is always conditioned by three qualities-good, bad, 
  and indeterminate-which produce patterns of Dharmas.<br>
  &quot;Are these Dharmas produced by the mind, or do they have a special place 
  apart from the mind?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if they were the mind, the Dharmas would not be its defiling objects. 
  Since they would not be conditions of the mind, how could you say that they 
  had a location?<br>
  &quot;Suppose they were to have a special place apart from the mind: then would 
  the Dharmas themselves be able to know?<br>
  &quot;If they were to have a sense of knowing, they would be called a mind. 
  If they were something other that you, they would be someone else's mind, since 
  they are not defiling objects. If they were the same as you, they would be your 
  own mind. But, how could your mind stand apart form you?<br>
  &quot;Suppose they were to have no sense of knowing ; yet these defiling objects 
  are not forms, sounds, smells, or tastes; they are neither coldness nor warmth, 
  nor the characteristic of emptiness. Where would they be located?<br>
  &quot;We have established that they are represented in neither form nor emptiness; 
  nor is it likely that they exist somewhere in the human realm beyond emptiness, 
  for if they did, the mind could not be aware of them. Whence, then, would they 
  arise?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that neither Dharmas nor the mind has a location. 
  And, so the two places of mind and Dharmas are empty and false. Their origin 
  is not in causes and conditions, nor do their natures arise spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, why do I say that the eighteen realms are basically 
  the wonderful nature of True Suchness, the treasury of the Thus Come One?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, as you understand it, the eyes and form create the conditions 
  that produce the eye-consciousness.<br>
  &quot;Is the consciousness produced because of the eyes, such that the eyes 
  are its realm? Or is it produced because of form, such that form is its realm?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if it were produced because of the eyes, then in the absence of 
  emptiness and form it would not be able to make distinctions; and, so even if 
  you had a consciousness, what use would it be?<br>
  &quot;Moreover, your seeing is neither green, yellow, red, nor white. There 
  is virtually nothing in which it is represented, therefore, what is the realm 
  established from?<br>
  &quot;Suppose it were produced because of form. In emptiness, when there was 
  no form, you consciousness would be extinguished. Then, why is it that the consciousness 
  knows the nature of emptiness?<br>
  &quot;Suppose a form changes. You are also conscious of the changing appearance; 
  but your eye-consciousness does not change. Where is the boundary established?<br>
  &quot;If the eye-consciousness were to change when form changed, then there 
  would be no appearance of a realm. If it were not to change, it would be constant, 
  and given that it was produced from form, it should have no conscious knowledge 
  of where there was emptiness.<br>
  &quot;Suppose the eye-consciousness arose both from the eyes and from form. 
  If they were united, there would still be a point of separation. If they were 
  separate, there would still be a point of contact. Hence, the substance and 
  nature would be chaotic and disorderly; how could a realm be set up?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should that as to the eyes and form being the conditions 
  that produce the realm of eye-consciousness, none of the three places exists. 
  Thus, the eyes, form, and the form-realm-these three-do not have their origin 
  in causes and conditions, nor do their natures arise spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, as you understand it, the ear and sound create the conditions 
  that produce the ear-consciousness.<br>
  &quot;Is this consciousness produced because of the ear such that the ear is 
  its realm, or is it produced because of sound, such that sound is its realm?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, suppose the ear-consciousness were produced because of the ear. 
  The organ of hearing would have no awareness in the absence of both movement 
  and stillness. Thus, nothing would be known by it. Since the organ would lack 
  awareness, what would characterize the consciousness?<br>
  &quot;You may hold that the ears hear, but when there is no movement and stillness, 
  hearing cannot occur. How, then, could the ears, which are but physical forms, 
  unite with external objects to be called the realm of consciousness? Once again, 
  therefore, how would the realm of consciousness be established?<br>
  &quot;Suppose it was produced from sound. If the consciousness existed because 
  of sound, then it would have no connection with hearing. Without hearing, then 
  the characteristic of sound would have no location.<br>
  &quot;Suppose consciousness existed because of sound. Given that sound exists 
  because of hearing, which causes the characteristic of sound to manifest, then 
  you should also hear the hearing-consciousness.<br>
  &quot;If the hearing-consciousness is not heard, there is no realm. If it is 
  heard, then it is the same as sound. If the consciousness itself is heard, who 
  is it that perceives and hears the consciousness? If there is no perceiver, 
  then in the end you would be like grass or wood.<br>
  &quot;Nor is it likely that the sound and hearing mix together to form a realm 
  in between. Since a realm in between could not be established, how could the 
  internal and external characteristics be delineated?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that as to the ear and sound creating the conditions 
  which produce the realm of the ear-consciousness, none of the three places exists. 
  Thus, the ear, sound, and sound-consciousness-these three -do not have their 
  origin in causes and conditions, nor do their natures arise spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, as you understand it, the nose and smells create the 
  conditions that produce the nose-consciousness.<br>
  &quot;Is this consciousness produced because of the nose, such that the nose 
  is its realm? Or, is it produced because of smells, such that smells are its 
  realm?<br>
  &quot;Suppose, Ananda, that the nose-consciousness were produced because of 
  the nose, then in your mind, what do you take to be the nose? Do you hold that 
  it takes the form of two fleshy claws, or do you hold it is an inherent ability 
  of the nature, which perceives smells as a result of movement?<br>
  &quot;Suppose you hold that it is fleshy claws which form an integral part of 
  your body. Since the body's perception is touch, the sense organ of smelling 
  would be named &quot;body&quot; instead of &quot;nose,&quot; and the objects 
  of smelling would be objects of touch. Since it would not even have the name 
  &quot;nose,&quot; how could a realm be established for it?<br>
  &quot;Suppose you held that the nose was the perceiver of smells. Then, in your 
  mind, what is it that perceives? Suppose it were the flesh that perceived. Basically, 
  what the flesh perceives is objects of touch, which have nothing to do with 
  the nose.<br>
  &quot;Suppose it were emptiness that perceived. Then emptiness would itself 
  be the perceiver, and the flesh would have no awareness. Thus, empty space would 
  be you, and since your body would be without perception, Ananda would not exist.<br>
  &quot;If it is the smell that perceives perception itself would lie with the 
  smell. What would that have to do with you?<br>
  &quot;If it is certain that vapors of fragrance and stench are produced from 
  your nose, then the two flowing vapors of fragrance and stench would not arise 
  from the wood of Airavana or Chandana. Given that the smell does not come from 
  these two things, when you smell your own nose, is it fragrant, or does it stink? 
  What stinks does not give off fragrance; what is fragrant does not stink.<br>
  &quot;Suppose you say you can smell both the fragrance and the stench; then 
  you, one person, would have two noses, and I would now be addressing questions 
  to two Anandas. Which one is you?<br>
  &quot;Suppose there is one nose; then fragrance and stench would not be two. 
  Since stench would be fragrance and fragrance would become stench, there would 
  not be two natures, thus what would make up the realm?<br>
  &quot;If the nose-consciousness were produced because of smells, it follows 
  that it is in existence just because of smells. Just as the eyes can see but 
  are unable to see themselves, so, too, if it exists because of smells, it could 
  not be aware of smells.<br>
  &quot;If it is aware of smells, then it is not produced from smells. If it had 
  no awareness, the realm of smelling would not come into being. If the consciousness 
  were not aware of smells, then the realm would not be established from smells.<br>
  &quot;Since there is no intermediate realm of consciousness, there is no basis 
  for establishing anything internal or external, either. Therefore, the nature 
  of smelling is ultimately empty and false.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that, as to the nose and smells being the conditions 
  which produce the realm of the nose-consciousness, none of the three places 
  exists. Thus, the nose, smells, and the realm of smelling-these three-do not 
  have their origin in causes and conditions, nor do their natures arise spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, as you understand it, the tongue and flavors create 
  the conditions that produce the tongue-consciousness.<br>
  &quot;Is the consciousness produced because of the tongue, such that the tongue 
  is its realm, or is it produced because of the flavors, such that the flavors 
  are its realm?<br>
  &quot;Suppose, Ananda, that it were produced because of the tongue. Then all 
  the sugar cane, black plums, huanh-lien, salt, wild ginger, ginger, and cassia 
  in the world would be entirely without flavor. Also, when you taste your own 
  tongue, is it sweet or bitter?<br>
  &quot;Suppose the nature of your tongue were bitter. Then, what would it be 
  that tasted the tongue? Since the tongue cannot taste itself, who would have 
  the sense of taste? <br>
  &quot;If the nature of the tongue were not bitter, there would be no flavor 
  engendered by it. Thus, how could a realm be established?<br>
  &quot;If it were produced because of flavor, the consciousness itself would 
  be a flavor. The case would be the same as with the tongue-organ being unable 
  to taste itself. How could the consciousness know whether it had flavor or not?<br>
  &quot;Moreover, flavors do not all come from one thing. Since flavors are produced 
  many things, the consciousness would have many things, the consciousness would 
  have many substances.<br>
  &quot;Suppose that the consciousness were of a single substance and that the 
  substance was definitely produced from flavor. Then, when salt, bland, sweet, 
  and pungent were combined, their various differences would change into a single 
  flavor and there would be no distinctions among them.<br>
  &quot;If there were no distinctions, it could not be called consciousness. So, 
  how could it further be called the realm of tongue, flavor, and consciousness?<br>
  &quot;Nor can it be that empty space produces your consciousness awareness.<br>
  &quot;The tongue and flavors could not combine without each losing its basic 
  nature. How could a realm be produced?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that, as to the tongue and flavors being conditions 
  that produce the realm of tongue-consciousness, none of the three places exists. 
  Thus, the tongue, flavors, and the realm of the tongue-these three-do not have 
  their origin in causes and conditions, nor do their natures arise spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, as you understand it, the body and objects of touch 
  create the conditions that produce the body-consciousness.<br>
  &quot;Is this consciousness produced because of the body, such that the body 
  is its realm, or is it produced because of objects of touch, such that objects 
  of touch are its realm?<br>
  &quot;Suppose, Ananda, that is were produced because of the body. When there 
  was no awareness of the two conditions of contact with and separation from objects 
  of touch, what would the body be conscious of?<br>
  &quot;Suppose it were produced because of objects of touch. Then you would not 
  need your body. Without a body, what could perceive contact with and separation 
  from objects of touch?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, things do not perceive objects of touch. It is the body that perceives 
  objects of touch.<br>
  &quot;What the body knows is objects of touch, and what is aware of objects 
  of touch is the body. What is objects of touch is not the body, and what is 
  the body is not objects of touch.<br>
  &quot;The two characteristics of body and objects of touch are basically without 
  a location. If it united with the body, it would be the body's own substance 
  and nature. If it were apart from the body, it would have the same appearance 
  as empty space.<br>
  &quot;Since the inside and the outside don't stand up, how can one set up a 
  middle? The middle cannot be set up, either. The inside and the outside are 
  by nature empty. From what realm, then, is your consciousness born?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that, as to the body and objects of touch being 
  the conditions that produce the realm of body-consciousness, none of the three 
  places exists. Thus, the body, objects of touch, and the realm of the body-these 
  three-do not have their origin in causes and conditions, nor do their natures 
  arise spontaneously.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, as you understand it, the mind and Dharmas create the 
  conditions that produce the mind-consciousness.<br>
  &quot;Is this consciousness produced because of the mind, such that the mind 
  is its realm, or is it produced because of Dharmas, such that Dharmas are its 
  realm?<br>
  &quot;Suppose, Ananda, that it were produced because of the mind. In your mind 
  there certainly must be thoughts; these give expression to your mind. If there 
  are no Dharmas before you, the mind does not give rise to anything. Apart from 
  conditions, it has no shape; thus, what use would the consciousness be?<br>
  &quot;Moreover, is your conscious awareness the same as your mind-organ, with 
  its capacity to understand and make distinctions, or is it different? If it 
  were the same as the mind, it would be the mind; how could it be something else 
  that arises? If it were different from the mind, it should there by be devoid 
  of consciousness. If there were no consciousness, how would it arise from the 
  mind? If there were consciousness, how would it differ from the mind? Since 
  it is by nature neither the same nor different, how can a realm be established?<br>
  &quot;Suppose it were produced because of Dharmas. None of the Dharmas of the 
  world exists apart from the five defiling objects. Consider the Dharmas of form, 
  the Dharmas of sound, the Dharmas of smell, the Dharmas of taste, and the Dharmas 
  of touch: each has a clearly distinguishable appearance and is matched with 
  one of the five organs. They are not what the mind takes in.<br>
  &quot;Suppose your consciousness were indeed produced through a reliance on 
  Dharmas. Take a close look at them now: what does each and every Dharma look 
  like?<br>
  &quot;Underlying the characteristics of form and emptiness, movement and stillness, 
  penetration and obstruction, unity and separation, and production and extinction, 
  there is nothing at all.<br>
  &quot;When there is production, then form, emptiness, and all Dharmas are produced. 
  When there is extinction, then form, emptiness, and all Dharmas are extinguished. 
  Since what is causal does not exist, if those causes produce the consciousness, 
  what appearance does the consciousness assume? If there is nothing discernable 
  about the consciousness, how can a realm be established for it?<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that, as to the mind and Dharmas being the 
  conditions that produce the realm of the mind-consciousness, none of the three 
  places exists. Thus, the mind, Dhamas, and the realm of the mind-these three-do 
  not have their origin in causes and conditions, nor do their natures arise spontaneously.<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, the Thus Come One has often 
  spoken of the mixture and union of causes and conditions, saying that the transformations 
  of everything in the world are created from the mixing and uniting of the four 
  elements.<br>
  &quot;Why does the Thus Come One reject causes and conditions and spontaneity 
  as well? I do not know how to understand your meaning now.<br>
  &quot;Please be so compassionate as to instruct us living beings in the final 
  meaning of the Middle Way-in the Dharmas which are not idle theories.&quot;<br>
  The World Honored One then told Ananda, &quot;You have renounced the Small Vehicle 
  Dharmas of the Sound-hearers and those enlightened to conditions and have resolved 
  to diligently seek unsurpassed Bodhi. Because of that, I will now explain the 
  foremost truth to you.<br>
  &quot;Why do you still bind yourself up in the idle theories and false thoughts 
  current among people of the world?<br>
  &quot;Although you are very learned, you are like someone who can discuss medicines 
  but cannot distinguish a real medicine when it is placed before you. The Thus 
  Come One says that you are truly pitiful.<br>
  &quot;Listen attentively now as I explain this point in detail for you and also 
  for those of the future who cultivate the great vehicle, so that you all can 
  penetrate to the real appearance.&quot;<br>
  Ananda was silent and awaited the Buddha's holy instruction.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, according to what you said, the mixing and uniting of the four 
  elements create the myriad transformations if everything in the world.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if the nature of those elements does not mix and unite in substance, 
  then they cannot combine with other elements, just as empty space cannot combine 
  with forms.<br>
  &quot;Assuming that they do mix and unite, they are then only in a process of 
  transformation in which they depend on one another for existence from beginning 
  to end. In the course of transformation they are produced and extinguished-being 
  born and then dying, dying and then being born, in birth after birth, in death 
  after death, the way a torch spun in a circle forms an unbroken wheel of flame.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, the process is like water becoming ice and ice becoming water 
  again.<br>
  &quot;Consider the nature of earth: its coarse particles make up the great earth. 
  Its fine particles make up motes of dust, down to and including motes of dust 
  bordering upon emptiness.<br>
  &quot;If one divides those fine motes of dust, their appearance is at the boundaries 
  of form. Then divide those into seven parts.<br>
  &quot;Aanada, if this mote of dust bordering upon emptiness is divided and becomes 
  emptiness, it should be that emptiness can give rise to form.<br>
  &quot;Just now you asked if mixing and uniting doesn't bring about the transformations 
  of everything in the world.<br>
  &quot;You should carefully consider how much emptiness mixes and unites to make 
  a single mote of dust bordering upon emptiness, since it makes no sense to say 
  that dust bordering on emptiness is composed of dust bordering on emptiness.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, since motes of dust bordering upon emptiness can be reduced 
  to emptiness, of how many motes of such form as this must emptiness be composed?<br>
  &quot;When these motes of form mass together, a mass of form does not make emptiness; 
  when emptiness is massed together, a mass of emptiness does not make form. Besides, 
  although form can be divided, how can emptiness be massed together?<br>
  &quot;You simply do not know that in the treasury of the Thus Come One the nature 
  of form is true emptiness, and the nature of emptiness is true form. Pure at 
  its origin, it pervades the Dharma realm. It accords with living beings' minds, 
  in response to their capacity to know.<br>
  &quot;It is experienced to whatever extent is dictated by the law of Karma. 
  Ignorant of this fact, people in the world are so deluded as to assign its origin 
  to causes and conditions or to spontaneity. These mistakes, which arise from 
  the discriminations and reasoning processes of the conscious mind, are nothing 
  but the play of empty words which have no real meaning.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, fire, which has no nature of its own, depends upon various causes 
  and conditions for its existence. Consider a family in the city that has not 
  yet eaten. When they wish to prepare food, they hold up a speculum to the sun, 
  seeking fire.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, let us look into your suggestion that the fire comes forth from 
  mixing and uniting. By way of example, you and I and the twelve hundred and 
  fifty Bhikshus unite together to form a community. However, a careful analysis 
  of the community reveals that every member composing it has his own body, birthplace, 
  clan, and name. For instance, Shariputra is a Brahman; Uruvilva is of the Kashyapa 
  clan, and you, Ananda, come from the Gautama family.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, suppose fire existed because of mixing and uniting. When the hand 
  holds up the speculum to the sun to seek fire, does the fire come out of the 
  speculum? Does it come out of moxa tinder? Or does it come from the sun?<br>
  &quot;Suppose, Ananda, that it came from the sun. Not only would it burn the 
  moxa tinder in your hand, but as it came across the groves of trees, it should 
  burn them up as well.<br>
  &quot;Suppose that it came from the speculum. Since it came out from within 
  the speculum to ignite the moxa tinder, why doesn't the speculum melt? Yet your 
  hand that holds it feels no heat; how, then, could the speculum melt?<br>
  &quot;Suppose that the fire came from the moxa tinder. Then why is fire generated 
  only when the bright mirror comes into contact with the dazzling light?<br>
  &quot;Furthermore, on closer examination you will find the speculum held in 
  hands, the sun high up in the sky, and moxa grown from the ground. Where does 
  the fire come from? How can it travel some distance to reach here?<br>
  &quot;The sun and the speculum cannot mix and unite, since they are far apart 
  from each other. Nor can it be that the fire exists spontaneously, without an 
  origin.<br>
  &quot;You simply do not know that in the treasury of the Thus Come One, the 
  nature of fire is true emptiness, and the nature of emptiness is true fire. 
  Pure at its origin, it pervades the Dharma realm. It accords with living beings' 
  minds, in response to their capacity to know.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, you should know that fire is generated in the place where a speculum 
  is held up to the sunlight, and fire will be generated everywhere if specula 
  are held up to the sunlight throughout the Dharmas realm. Since fire can come 
  forth throughout the whole world, can there be any fixed place to which it is 
  confined?<br>
  &quot;It is experienced to whatever extent is dictated by the Law of Karma. 
  Ignorant of this fact, people in the world are so deluded as to assign its origin 
  to causes and conditions or to spontaneity. These mistakes, which arise from 
  the discriminations and reasoning processes of the conscious mind, are nothing 
  but the play of empty words which have no real meaning.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, water is by nature unstable. It may keep on flowing or come to 
  a stop. Kapila, Chakra, Padma, and Hasta, and other great magicians of Shravasti 
  often hold up instruments to the light of the full moon at midnight to extract 
  from the moon the essence of water to mix with their drugs.<br>
  &quot;Does the water come out of the crystal ball? Does it exist of itself in 
  space? Or, does it come from the moon?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, suppose the water came from the distant moon. Water then should 
  also flow from all the grass and trees when the moonlight passes over them on 
  its way to the crystal ball! If it does flow from them, why wait for it to come 
  out of the crystal ball? If it does not flow from the trees, then it is clear 
  that the water does not descend from the moon.<br>
  &quot;If it came from the crystal balls, then it should flow from the crystal 
  all the time. Why would they have to wait for midnight and the light of the 
  full moon to receive it?<br>
  &quot;If it came from space, which is by nature boundless, it would flow everywhere, 
  until everything between earth and sky was submerged. How, then, could there 
  still be travel by water, land, and space?<br>
  &quot;Furthermore, upon closer examination you will find that the moon moves 
  through the sky, the crystal ball is held in the hand, and the pan for receiving 
  the water is put there by someone; but, where does the water that flows into 
  the pan come from?<br>
  &quot;The moon and the crystal balls cannot mix or unite, since they are far 
  apart. Nor can it be that the essence of water exists spontaneously without 
  an origin.<br>
  &quot;You still do not know that in the treasury of the Thus Come One, the nature 
  of water is true emptiness, and the nature of emptiness is true water. Pure 
  in its origin, it pervades the Dharma realm. It accords with living beings' 
  minds, in response to their capacity to know.<br>
  &quot;A crystal ball is held up at a certain place, and there water comes forth. 
  If crystal balls were held up throughout the Dharma realm, then throughout the 
  Dharma realm water would come forth. Since water can come forth throughout the 
  entire world, can there be any fixed place to which it is confined?<br>
  &quot;It is experienced to whatever extent is dictated by the Law of Karma. 
  Ignorant of this fact, people in the world are so deluded as to assign their 
  origin to causes and conditions or to spontaneity. These mistakes, which arise 
  from the discriminations and reasoning processes of the conscious mind, are 
  nothing but the play of empty words, which have no real meaning.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, by nature, the wind has no substance, and its movement and stillness 
  are erratic. You always adjust your robe as you enter the great assembly. When 
  the corner of your Samghati brushes the person next to you, there is a slight 
  breeze which stirs against that person's face.<br>
  &quot;Does this wind come from the corner of the Kashaya, does it arise from 
  emptiness, or is it produced from the face of the person brushed by the wind?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if the wind comes from the corner of the Kashaya, you are then 
  clad in the wind, and your Kashaya should fly about and leave your body. I am 
  now speaking Dharma in the midst of the assembly, and my robe remains motionless 
  and hangs straight down. You should look closely at my robe to see whether there 
  is any wind in it. It cannot be that the wind is stored somewhere in the robe, 
  either.<br>
  &quot;If it arose from emptiness, why wouldn't the wind brush against the man 
  even when your robe did not move? Emptiness is constant in nature; thus, the 
  wind should constantly arise. When there was no wind, the emptiness should disappear. 
  You can perceive the disappearance of the wind; but, what would the disappearance 
  of emptiness look like? If it did arise and disappear, it could not be what 
  is called emptiness. Since it is what is called emptiness, how can it generate 
  wind?<br>
  &quot;If the wind came from the face of the person by your side, it would blow 
  upon you while you set your robe in order. Why would it blow backwards upon 
  the person from whom it was generated?<br>
  &quot;Upon closer examination, you will find that the robe is set in order by 
  yourself, the face blown by the wind belongs to the person by your side, and 
  the emptiness is tranquil and not involved in movement. Where, then, does the 
  wind come from that blows in this place?<br>
  &quot;The wind and emptiness cannot mix and unite, since they are different 
  from each other. Nor should it be that the wind spontaneously exists without 
  an origin.<br>
  &quot;You still do not know that in the treasury of the Thus Come One the nature 
  of wind is true emptiness, and the nature of emptiness is true wind. Pure at 
  its origin, it pervades the Dharma realm. It accords with living beings' minds, 
  in response to their capacity to know.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, in the same way that you, as one person, move your robe slightly, 
  and a small wind arises, so a wind arises in all countries if there is a similar 
  movement throughout the Dharma realm. Since it can be produced throughout the 
  world, how can there be any fixed place to which it is confined?<br>
  &quot;It is experienced to whatever extent is dictated by the Law of Karma. 
  Ignorant of this fact, people in the world are so deluded as to assign their 
  origin to causes and conditions or to spontaneity. These mistakes, which arise 
  from the discriminations and reasoning processes of the conscious mind, are 
  nothing but the play of empty words, which bear no real meaning.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, the nature of emptiness has no shape; it is only apparent because 
  of form. For instance, Shravasti is far from the river, so when the Kshatriyas, 
  Brahmans, Vaishyas, Shudras, Bharadvajas, Chandalas, and so forth, build their 
  homes there, they dig wells seeking water. Where a foot of earth is removed, 
  there is a foot of emptiness; where as many as ten feet of earth are removed, 
  there are ten feet of emptiness. The depth of the emptiness corresponds to the 
  amount of earth removed.<br>
  &quot;Does this emptiness come out of the dirt, does it exist because of the 
  digging, or does it arise of itself without a cause?<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, suppose this emptiness arose of itself without any cause, 
  why wasn't it unobstructed before the earth was dug? Quite the contrary, one 
  saw only the great earth; there was no emptiness evident in it.<br>
  &quot;If emptiness came about because of the removal of the earth, we should 
  have seen it entering the well as the earth was removed. If emptiness was not 
  seen entering the well when the earth was first removed, how can we say that 
  emptiness came about because of the removal of the earth?<br>
  &quot;If there is no going in or coming out, then there is no difference between 
  the earth and emptiness. Why, then, doesn't emptiness come out of the well along 
  with the earth in the process of digging?<br>
  &quot;If emptiness appeared because of the digging, then the digging would bring 
  out emptiness instead of the earth. If emptiness does not come out because of 
  the digging, then the digging yields only earth. Why, then, do we see emptiness 
  appear as the well is dug?<br>
  &quot;You should consider this even more carefully. Look into it deeply, and 
  you will find that the digging comes from the person's hand as its means of 
  conveyance, and the earth exists because of a change in the ground. But what 
  causes the emptiness to appear?<br>
  &quot;The digging and the emptiness, one being substantial and the other insubstantial, 
  do not function on the same plane. They do not mix and unite. Nor can it be 
  that emptiness exists spontaneously without an origin.<br>
  &quot;Although the nature of emptiness is completely pervasive, it is basically 
  unmoving. You should know that it and earth, water, fire, and wind are together 
  called the five elements. Their natures are true and perfectly fused, and all 
  are the treasury of the Thus Come One, fundamentally devoid of production and 
  extinction.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, your mind is murky and confused, and you do not awaken to the 
  fact that the source of the four elements is none other than the treasury of 
  the Thus Come One. Why do you not take a look at emptiness to see whether it 
  is subject to such relativities as coming and going?<br>
  &quot;You do not know at all that in the treasury of the Thus Come One the nature 
  of enlightenment is true emptiness, and the nature of emptiness is true enlightenment. 
  Pure at its origin, it pervades the Dharma realm. It accords with living beings' 
  minds, in response to their capacity to know.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if in one place there is a well empty of earth, there will be 
  emptiness filling up that one place. If there are wells empty of earth in the 
  ten directions, there will be emptiness filling them up in the ten directions. 
  Since it fills up the ten directions, is there any fixed location in which emptiness 
  is found?<br>
  &quot;It is experienced to whatever extent is dictated by the Law of Karma. 
  Ignorant of this fact, people in the world are so deluded as to assign their 
  origin to causes and conditions or to spontaneity. These mistakes, which arise 
  from the discriminations and reasoning processes of the conscious mind, are 
  nothing but the play of empty words, which bear no real meaning.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, the seeing-awareness does not perceive by itself. It depends upon 
  form and emptiness for its existence. You are now in the Jeta Grove where you 
  see brightness in the morning and darkness in the evening. Deep in the night 
  you will see brightness when the moon arises and darkness when no moon is visible. 
  The brightness and darkness are discerned by the seeing.<br>
  &quot;Is the seeing identical in substance with brightness, darkness, and emptiness, 
  are they not the same substance? Are they the same and yet different, or are 
  they not the same and yet not different?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, suppose seeing were one with brightness, darkness, and emptiness. 
  It so happens that where there is darkness there is no brightness, and where 
  there is brightness there is no darkness, because the two cancel each other 
  out. If it were one with darkness, it would cease to exist in brightness; if 
  it were one with brightness, it would cease to exist in darkness. Such being 
  the case, how could it perceive both brightness and darkness? If brightness 
  and darkness differ from each other, how can they form a unity with seeing, 
  which transcends production and destruction?<br>
  &quot;Suppose that the essence of seeing were not of one substance with brightness 
  and darkness, and that you were separate from light, darkness, and emptiness. 
  Then what shape and appearance would the source of the seeing have, as you distinguish 
  it?<br>
  &quot;In the absence of darkness, brightness, and emptiness, the seeing would 
  be the same as hair on a tortoise or horns on a hare. How could we establish 
  the seeing-perception without the presence of the three qualities of brightness, 
  darkness, and emptiness?<br>
  &quot;How could we say that the seeing was one with darkness and brightness, 
  since brightness and darkness are opposites? Yet, how can we say that it was 
  different from the three qualities mentioned, since in their absence the seeing-perception 
  can never be established?<br>
  &quot;How could we say that the seeing was not one with emptiness, since no 
  boundary is established between them when they are separated from each other? 
  How could we say that they were not different, since the seeing always remains 
  unchanged, regardless of whether it is perceiving brightness or perceiving darkness?<br>
  &quot;You should examine this in even greater detail, investigate in minutely, 
  consider and contemplate it carefully. The light comes from the sun and darkness 
  from the absence of the moon; penetration belongs to emptiness, and solidity 
  returns to the earth. From what does the essence of seeing arise?<br>
  &quot;Seeing has awareness, and emptiness is inanimate: they do not mix and 
  unite. Nor can it be that the essence of seeing arises spontaneously without 
  an origin.<br>
  &quot;If the faculties of seeing, hearing, and knowing are by nature all pervasive 
  and unmoving, you should know that the stable, boundless emptiness, together 
  with the unstable elements such as earth, water, fire, and wind, are together 
  known as the six elements. They are, in nature, true and perfectly fused and 
  thus are the treasury of the Thus Come One, fundamentally devoid of production 
  and destruction.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, your nature is so submerged that you have not realized that your 
  seeing, hearing, awareness, and knowing are basically the treasury of the Thus 
  Come One. You should contemplate seeing, hearing, awareness, and knowing to 
  see whether they are subject to production and extinction; whether they are 
  identical or different; whether they are not subject to production and extinction; 
  and whether they are not identical and not different.<br>
  &quot;You still don't know that in the treasury of the Thus Come One the nature 
  of seeing is enlightened brightness; the essence of enlightenment is bright 
  seeing. Pure at its origin, it pervades the Dharma realm.<br>
  &quot;It accords with living beings' minds in response to their capacity to 
  know. Consider, for example, the sense organ of seeing. Its seeing pervades 
  the Dharma realm. The same is true of the luster of the wonderful virtue of 
  hearing, smelling, tasting, contact, and knowing. Since they fill emptiness 
  in the ten directions throughout the Dharma realm, how could there be any fixed 
  location in which they are found?<br>
  &quot;It is experienced to whatever extent is dictated by the Law of Karma. 
  Ignorant of this fact, people in the world are so deluded as to assign their 
  origin to causes and conditions or to spontaneity. These mistakes, which arise 
  from the discriminations and reasoning processes of the conscious mind, are 
  nothing but the play of empty words, which have no real meaning.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, the nature of consciousness has no source, but is a false manifestation 
  based on the six organs and objects. Now, take a look at the entire holy assembly 
  gathered here. As you glance at each one in turn, everything you see is like 
  what is seen in a mirror, where nothing has any special distinction.<br>
  &quot;However, your consciousness will identify them on by one: for example, 
  Manjushri, Purna, Maudgalyayana, Subhuti, and Shariputra.<br>
  &quot;Does the discerning faculty of the conscious mind come from seeing, from 
  forms, or from emptiness, or does it arise suddenly without a cause?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, suppose your consciousness came from seeing. If there were no 
  brightness, darkness, form, and emptiness-if these four did not exist-you could 
  not see. With seeing non-existent, what would be the origin of your consciousness?<br>
  &quot;If your consciousness arose from form rather than from seeing, it would 
  not see either in brightness or in darkness. In the absence of brightness and 
  darkness, it would not see form or emptiness, either. In the absence of form, 
  where would your consciousness come from?<br>
  &quot;If it came from emptiness, it is neither an appearance nor the seeing. 
  Since it does not see, it is unable by itself to discern brightness, darkness, 
  form, or emptiness. Since it is not an appearance, it is in itself devoid of 
  external conditions. Therefore, there is no place for seeing, hearing, awareness, 
  and knowing to be established.<br>
  &quot;Since its location is devoid of these two, the consciousness that arises 
  from emptiness would be the same as non-existent. Even if it did exist, it would 
  not be the same as a thing. Even if your consciousness came forth from it, how 
  would it discern anything?<br>
  &quot;If it suddenly comes forth without a cause, why can't you discern the 
  moonlight within the sunlight?<br>
  &quot;You should investigate this even more carefully, discriminate it in detail, 
  and look into it. The seeing belongs to your eyes; the appearances are considered 
  to be the environment; what was an appearance is existent; what is without any 
  appearance is non-existent. What, then, are the conditions that cause the consciousness 
  to come into being?<br>
  &quot;The consciousness moves and the seeing is quiet; they do not mix and unite. 
  Smelling, hearing, awareness, and knowing are the same way. Nor should it be 
  that the condition of consciousness exists spontaneously without an origin.<br>
  &quot;If this conscious mind does not come from anywhere, you should know that 
  the same is true of the mind, which makes distinctions, and the seeing, hearing, 
  awareness, and knowing, which are all complete and tranquil. Their nature is 
  without an origin. They and emptiness, earth, water, fire, and wind are together 
  called the seven elements. Their true natures are perfectly fused, and all are 
  the treasury of the Thus Come One, fundamentally devoid of production and extinction.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, your mind is coarse and shallow, and so you do not realize that 
  the seeing and hearing are the treasury of the Thus Come One, and you do not 
  discover that knowing is the same way. You should contemplate these six locations 
  of consciousness: are they the same or different? Are they empty or existent? 
  Are they neither the same nor different? Are they neither empty nor existent?<br>
  &quot;You basically do not know that in the treasury of the Thus Come One the 
  nature of consciousness is bright and knowing. Enlightened brightness is the 
  true consciousness. The wonderful enlightenment is tranquil and pervades the 
  Dharma realm.<br>
  &quot;It encompasses the emptiness of the ten directions and issues forth in 
  it. How can it have a location?<br>
  &quot;It is experienced to whatever extent is dictated by the Law of Karma. 
  Ignorant of this fact, people in the world are so deluded as to assign their 
  origin to causes and conditions or to spontaneity. These mistakes, which arise 
  from the discriminations and reasoning processes of the conscious mind, are 
  nothing but the play of empty words, which have no real meaning.<br>
  At that time, Ananda and the great assembly, filled with the subtle, wonderful 
  instruction of the Buddha, the Thus Come One, were peaceful in body and mind 
  and were without obstructions. Everyone in the great assembly became aware that 
  his or her mind pervaded the ten directions, beholding emptiness in the ten 
  directions as one might look at a leaf or at an object held in one's hands.<br>
  All the things that exist in the world were the wonderfully bright inherent 
  mind of Bodhi.<br>
  The essence of the mind was completely pervading and contained the ten directions.<br>
  Then they looked back upon their bodies born of their parents as a fine mote 
  of dust blown about in the emptiness of the ten directions; sometimes visible, 
  sometimes not, as a single bubble floating on the clear, vast sea, appearing 
  from nowhere and disappearing into oblivion. They comprehended and knew for 
  themselves, and obtained their fundamental wonderful mind, which is everlasting 
  and cannot be extinguished.<br>
  They bowed to the Buddha and placed their palms together, having obtained what 
  they had never had before. Then, facing the Thus Come One, Ananda spoke verses 
  in praise of the Buddha.<br>
  &quot;The wonderful deep Dharani, <br>
  The unmoving Honored One, <br>
  The foremost Shurangama king <br>
  Is seldom found in the world. <br>
  It melts away my upside-down thought <br>
  Gathered in a million Kalpas. <br>
  So I needn't endure Asamkhyeya aeons <br>
  To obtain the Dharma body. <br>
  I wish now to achieve the result <br>
  And become an honored king, <br>
  Who then returns to save as many beings <br>
  As there are sand-grains in the Ganges. <br>
  I offer this deep thought to those who are <br>
  As countless as the motes of dust of the Buddhalands, <br>
  To repay the kindness shown me by the Buddha. <br>
  In obeisance I ask the World Honored One to certify my vow to first enter the 
  five turbid evil realms. <br>
  If there is even one being who hasn't become a Buddha, at death I will not reach 
  for Nirvana. <br>
  May the exalted hero's awesome strength, his kindness and compassion, <br>
  Search out and dispel even the most subtle of my doubts. <br>
  Causing me to quickly attain the supreme enlightenment, <br>
  And sit in the Bodhimanda of the worlds of the ten directions. <br>
  Should even the Shunyata nature entirely melt away, <br>
  This Vajra mind will never waver.&quot; </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  <b>VOLUME 4<br></b>
  Then Purnamaitreyaniputra arose from his seat in the midst of the great assembly, 
  uncovered his right shoulder, knelt on his right knee, put his palms together 
  respectfully, and said to the Buddha, &quot;The most virtuous and awe-inspiring 
  World Honored One has for the sake of living beings expounded the primary truth 
  of the Thus Come One with remarkable eloquence.&quot;<br>
  &quot;The World Honored One often singles me out as the foremost among speakers 
  of Dharma. But now when I hear the wonderful and subtle expression of the Dharma, 
  I am like a deaf person who at a distance of more than a hundred paces tries 
  to hear a mosquito, which in fact cannot be seen, let alone heard.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, although Ananda and those like him have become enlightened, 
  they have not yet cast out their habits and outflows.<br>
  We in the assembly have reached the level of no outflows. Yet, although we have 
  no outflows, we still have doubts about the Dharma we have now heard the Thus 
  Come One speak.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, if all the sense organs, sense objects, Skandhas, places, 
  and realms in all the world are the treasury of the Thus Come One, originally 
  pure, why do there suddenly arise the mountains, the rivers, and the great earth-all 
  conditioned appearances which cyclically change and flow, end and then begin 
  again?<br>
  &quot;Moreover, the Thus Come One said that earth, water, fire, and wind are 
  by nature perfectly fused, are all-pervasive in the Dharma realm, and are all 
  tranquil and everlasting.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, if the nature of earth is pervasive, how can it contain 
  water? If the nature of water is pervasive, then fire does not arise. Further, 
  how do you explain that the natures of fire and water can each pervade empty 
  space without displacing one another? World Honored One, the nature of earth 
  is solid; the nature of emptiness is penetrating. How can they both pervade 
  the Dharma realm? I don't know where this doctrine is leading.<br>
  &quot;I only hope the Thus Come One will compassionately explain in order to 
  rend the clouds of confusion in me and among the great assembly.&quot; After 
  saying this, he made a full prostration and respectfully and expectantly awaited 
  the Thus Come One's unsurpassed compassionate instruction. <br>
  The World Honored One then told Purna and all the Arhats in the assembly who 
  had extinguished their outflows and had reached the level of no study, &quot;Today 
  the Thus Come One will explain in depth the true, supreme meaning within the 
  supreme meaning in order to cause all of you in the assembly who are Fixed-nature 
  Sound-hearers and those Arhats who have not realized the two kinds of emptiness, 
  but are dedicated to the superior vehicle, as well as the others, to obtain 
  the place of still extinction, the one vehicle, the true Aranya, the proper 
  place of cultivation. Listen attentively and I will explain it for you.&quot; 
  Purna and the others revering the Buddha's expression of Dharma, listened silently.<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Purna, you have asked why in fundamental purity the mountains, 
  the rivers, and the great earth suddenly arise.<br>
  &quot;Have you not often heard the Thus Come One expound upon the wonderful 
  light of the enlightened nature and the bright wonder of the fundamental enlightenment?&quot;<br>
  Purna said, &quot;Yes, World Honored One, I have often heard the Buddha expound 
  upon this subject.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;You speak of the light of enlightenment; is it that the 
  natural light is called enlightenment? Or are you saying that enlightenment 
  is initially without light and that then there is a so-called brightening of 
  the enlightenment?&quot;<br>
  Purna said, &quot;If the absence of light is called enlightenment, then there 
  is no light whatever.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;If there is no bright enlightenment without light added 
  to it, then it is not enlightenment with it; and it is not light without it. 
  The absence of light is not the still, bright nature of enlightenment, either.<br>
  &quot;The nature of enlightenment is essentially bright. It is false for you 
  to make it bright enlightenment.<br>
  &quot;Enlightenment is not something that needs to be made bright, for once 
  that is done, and object is established because of this light. Once an object 
  is falsely set up, you as a false subject come into being.<br>
  &quot;In the midst of what is neither the same nor different, difference blazes 
  forth. And what is different from that difference becomes sameness, because 
  of the difference. Once sameness and difference are created then due to them 
  what is neither the same nor different is further established.<br>
  &quot;This turmoil eventually brings about weariness. Prolonged weariness produces 
  defilement. The combination of these in a murky turbidity creates affliction 
  with respect to wearisome defilement.<br>
  &quot;Arisal is the world; stillness is emptiness. Emptiness is sameness; the 
  world is difference. What is neither sameness nor difference is the actual conditioned 
  Dharmas.<br>
  &quot;The interaction of bright enlightenment and dark emptiness sets them in 
  a perpetual rotation; thus there is the pervasiveness of wind which supports 
  the world.<br>
  &quot;Because emptiness produces movement, hardened light sets up a solidity 
  which is the store of metal. Bright enlightenment makes this hardness; thus 
  there is the pervasiveness of metal, which secures the lands.<br>
  &quot;Obstinate attachment to unenlightened awareness results in the formation 
  of metals, while the vibration of illusory awareness causes wind to rise up. 
  The wind and metal rub together; thus there is the light of fire, which is changeable 
  by nature.<br>
  &quot;The brightness of the metal produces moisture, and from the light of fire 
  steam arises; thus there is the pervasiveness of water, which encompasses realms 
  in the ten directions.<br>
  &quot;Fire rises and water falls, and the combination sets up solidity. What 
  is wet becomes the oceans and seas; what is dry becomes in continents and islands.<br>
  &quot;Because of this, fire often rises up in the oceans, and on the continents 
  the streams and rivers ever flow.<br>
  &quot;When the power of water is less than that of fire, high mountains result, 
  so it is that mountain rocks give off sparks when struck, and become liquid 
  when melted.<br>
  &quot;When the power of earth is less than that of water, the outcome is grasses 
  and trees. So it is that groves and meadows turn to ashes when burned and ooze 
  water when twisted.<br>
  &quot;A falseness is produced with interaction as the seeds, and from these 
  causes and conditions comes the continuity of the world.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Purna, the false brightness is none other than the mistake of 
  adding light to enlightenment.<br>
  &quot;After the falseness of an object is established, the faculty of understanding 
  cannot transcend it. Due to this cause and condition, hearing does not go beyond 
  sound, and seeing does not surpass form.<br>
  &quot;Forms, smells, tastes, and objects of touch-six falsenesses are realized. 
  Because of them, there is division into seeing, sensation, hearing, and knowing.<br>
  &quot;Similar Karma binds together: union and separation bring about transformation.<br>
  &quot;One sees that a bright spot is generated. At the sight of the bright spot 
  conception comes into being. Differing views produce hatred; similar views create 
  love. The flow of love becomes a seed, and the conception is drawn into the 
  womb. Intercourse happens with a mutual attraction of similar Karma. And so 
  there are the causes and conditions that create the Kalala, the Arbuda, and 
  the rest.<br>
  &quot;The womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and transformation-born come about 
  in response: the egg-born come from thought, the womb-born are due to emotion, 
  the moisture-born arise from union, and transformations occur through separation.<br>
  &quot;Emotion, thought, union, and separation go through further changes, and 
  from all the Karma received one either rises or sinks. From these causes and 
  conditions comes the continuity of living beings.<br>
  &quot;Purna, thought and love become bound together so that people love each 
  other and cannot bear to be apart. As a result, the world was seen an endless 
  succession of births of parents, children, and grandchildren. And the basis 
  for all of this is desire and greed.<br>
  &quot;Greed and love feed on one another until greed becomes insatiable. As 
  a result, in the world all the sentient beings born of eggs, wombs, moisture, 
  and by transformation tend to devour one another for the nourishment of their 
  bodies to the extent that their strength permits. And the basis for all of this 
  is killing and greed.<br>
  &quot;A person eats a sheep. The sheep dies and becomes a person. The person 
  dies and becomes a sheep, and it goes on that way through ten births and more. 
  Through death after death and birth after birth, they come back to eat one another. 
  The evil Karma becomes innate and exhausts the bounds of the future. And the 
  basis for all of this is stealing and greed.<br>
  &quot;You owe me a life; I have to repay my debt to you. From these causes and 
  conditions, we pass through hundreds of thousands of aeons, in a sustained cycle 
  of birth and death.<br>
  &quot;You love my mind; I adore your form. From these causes and conditions 
  we pass through hundreds of thousands of aeons, in a sustained mutual entanglement.<br>
  &quot;Killing, stealing, and lust are themselves the basis roots. From these 
  causes and conditions comes the continuity of Karmic retribution.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, Purna, the three kinds of upside-down continuity come from 
  the light which is added to enlightenment. With this false enlightening of the 
  knowing-nature, subjective awareness gives rise to objective appearances. Both 
  are born of false views, and from this falseness the mountains, the rivers, 
  the great earth, and all conditioned appearances unfold themselves in a succession 
  that recurs in endless cycles.<br>
  Purna said, &quot;If this wonderful enlightenment, this basis miraculous enlightened 
  brightness which is neither greater than nor less than the mind of the Thus 
  Come One, abruptly brings forth the mountains, the rivers, and the great earth, 
  and all conditioned appearances, then now that the Thus Come One has attained 
  the wonderful empty bright enlightenment, will the mountains, the rivers, the 
  great earth, and all conditioned habitual outflows arise again?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Purna, &quot;Consider for example a person who has become 
  confused in a village, mistaking south for north. Is this confusion the result 
  of confusion or of awareness?&quot;<br>
  Purna said, &quot;This person's confusion is the result neither of confusion 
  nor of awareness. Why? Confusion is fundamentally baseless, so how could it 
  arise because of confusion? Awareness does not produce confusion, so how could 
  it arise because of awareness?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;If a person who is aware points out the way to the person 
  who is in the midst of confusion, and makes him aware, then do you suppose, 
  Purna, that once the person is over his confusion he could lose his sense of 
  direction again in that village?&quot; <br>
  &quot;No, World Honored One.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Purna, the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions are the same way. Confusion 
  is groundless and ultimately empty in nature. There had basically been no confusion: 
  it merely seemed as if there were confusion and enlightenment. When the delusion 
  about confusion and enlightenment is ended, enlightenment does not give rise 
  to confusion.<br>
  &quot;It is also like a person with an eye-ailment who sees flowers in space. 
  If he gets rid of his eye-ailment, the flowers in space will disappear. If he 
  were so stupid as to quickly return to the spot where the flowers disappear 
  and wait for them to reappear, would you consider that person to be stupid or 
  smart?&quot;<br>
  Purna said, &quot;Originally there weren't any flowers in space. It was through 
  a falseness in the seeing that they were produced and extinguished. To see the 
  disappearance of the flowers in space is already upside down. To wait for them 
  to reappear is sheer madness. Why bother to determine further if such a person 
  is stupid or smart?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Since you explain it that way, why do you ask if the 
  wonderful enlightened bright emptiness can once again give rise to the mountains, 
  the rivers, and the great earth?<br>
  &quot;It is like a piece of ore containing gold and a mixture of other metals. 
  Once the pure gold is extracted, it will not become an ore again. It is like 
  wood that has been burned to ashes; it will not become wood again.<br>
  &quot;The Bodhi and Nirvana of all Buddhas, the Thus Come Ones, are the same 
  way.<br>
  &quot;Purna, you also asked whether the natures of water and fire would not 
  destroy each other if the natures of earth, water, fire, and wind were all perfectly 
  fused and pervaded the Dharma realm, and whether subtle emptiness and the great 
  earth would not be incompatible if both pervaded the Dharma realm.<br>
  &quot;For example, Purna, the substance of emptiness is not the myriad things, 
  and yet it does not prevent the inclusion of all appearances within it.<br>
  &quot;Do you know the reason why? Purna, the empty space is bright on a sunny 
  day, and dark when the sky is cloudy. It moves when the wind rises up, it is 
  fresh when the sky clears. It is turbid and hazy when the weather is foul, it 
  is obscure when a dust-storm breaks out. It casts a bright reflection on a pool 
  of clear water.<br>
  &quot;What do you think of these conditions which come into existence at different 
  places? Are they created from these conditions themselves or do they find their 
  origin in emptiness? If they arise from those conditions, Purna, then on a sunny 
  day since the sun is bright, all the worlds of the ten directions should take 
  the form of the sun. Then how does it happen that on a sunny day one still sees 
  the round sun in the sky? If emptiness is bright, emptiness itself should shine. 
  How does it happen that when there is a covering of clouds and fog there is 
  no light in evidence?<br>
  &quot;You should know that brightness in not the sun, is not emptiness, and 
  is not other than the emptiness and the sun.<br>
  &quot;The truly wonderful enlightened brightness is the same way. If your Karma 
  finds expression in emptiness, then emptiness will appear. If your Karma finds 
  expression in one or another of earth, water, fire, or wind, that one will appear. 
  If your Karma finds expression in them all, they will all appear.<br>
  &quot;How can they all appear? Suppose, Purna, the sun's reflection appears 
  in a single body of water, and two people gaze at it, both at the same time. 
  Then one person walks east and the other walks west. Each person, still looking 
  in the water, will see a sun go along with him, one to the east, one to the 
  west, seemingly without there being any fixed direction for the movement of 
  the sun's reflection.<br>
  &quot;You shouldn't belabor the question and say, 'If there is one sun, how 
  can it follow both people? Since the sun is double, why does only one appear 
  in the sky?' this is just to revolve in falseness, because it cannot be proved. 
  <br>
  &quot;Contemplate the fundamental falseness of appearances. They are just like 
  flowers that are conjured up in space and produce empty fruit. Why, then, investigate 
  the meaning of their formation and disappearance?<br>
  &quot;Contemplate the fundamental truth of the nature. It is solely the wonderful 
  enlightened brightness, the wonderful enlightened bright mind. Originally, it 
  is neither water nor fire. Why, then, ask about incompatibility?<br>
  &quot;Purna, you think that form and emptiness over come and destroy one another 
  in the treasury of the Thus Come One. Thus the treasury of the Thus Come One 
  accordingly appears to you as form and emptiness throughout the Dharma realm.<br>
  &quot;And so, within it the wind moves, emptiness is still, the sun is bright, 
  and the clouds are dark. The reason for this lies in the delusion of living 
  beings who have turned their backs on enlightened and joined with the 'Dust.' 
  Thus, the wearisome defilements come into being and mundane appearances exist.<br>
  &quot;With the wonderful brightness that is not extinguished and not produced, 
  I unite with the treasury of the Thus Come One. Thus the treasury of the Thus 
  Come One is the unique and wonderful enlightened brightness, which completely 
  illumines the Dharma realm.<br>
  &quot;That is why, within it, the one is limitless; the limitless is one. In 
  the small appears the great; in the great appears the small.<br>
  &quot;Unmoving in the Bodhimanda, yet pervading the ten directions, my body 
  contains the ten directions and endless emptiness. On the tip of a single hair 
  appear the lands of the Jeweled kings. Sitting in a mote of dust, I turn the 
  great Dharma wheel, destroy the defilements, and unite with enlightenment, so, 
  True Suchness, the wonderful enlightened bright nature, comes into being.<br>
  &quot;The treasury of the Thus Come One is the fundamental, wonderful, perfect 
  mind.<br>
  &quot;It is not the mind, nor emptiness, nor earth, nor water, nor wind, nor 
  fire; it is not the eyes, nor the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body, or the 
  mind. It is not form, nor sound, smells, tastes, objects of touch, or Dharmas. 
  It is not the realm of eye-consciousness, nor any other, up to and including 
  the realm of mind-consciousness.<br>
  &quot;It is not understanding, nor ignorance, nor the ending of understanding 
  or ignorance, nor any other, up to and including old age and death and the ending 
  of old age and death.<br>
  &quot;It is not suffering, nor accumulation, nor extinction, nor the way, it 
  is neither knowing nor attaining.&quot;<br>
  &quot;It is not Dana, nor Shila, nor Virya, nor Kshanti nor Dhyana, nor Prajna, 
  nor Paramita.<br>
  &quot;Nor any other: it is not the Tathagata, nor the Arhats, nor Samyaksambodhi, 
  nor Parinirvana, nor permanence, nor bliss, nor true self, nor purity.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, it is neither mundane nor transcendental, since the treasury 
  of the Thus Come One is the fundamental brightness of the wonderful mind.<br>
  &quot;It is the mind, it is emptiness, it is earth, it is water, it is wind, 
  it is fire, it is the eyes, it is the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body, 
  and the mind. It is form, it is sounds, smells, tastes, objects of touch, and 
  Dharmas. It is the realm of eye-consciousness, and so forth, up to and including 
  the realm of mind-consciousness.<br>
  &quot;It is understanding and ignorance and the ending of understanding and 
  ignorance, and so forth up to and including old age and death and the ending 
  of old age and death. It is suffering, it is accumulation, it is extinction, 
  and it is the way. It is knowing and attaining. It is Dana, it is Shila, it 
  is Virya, it is Kshanti, it is Dhyana, it is Prajna, and it is Paramita, and 
  so forth, up to and including the Tathagata, the Arhats, Samyaskambodhi, Parinirvana, 
  permanence, bliss, true self, and purity.<br>
  &quot;It is both mundane and transcendental, since the treasury of the Thus 
  Come One is the wonderful brightness of the fundamental mind.<br>
  &quot;It is apart from 'is' and 'is not.' It is identical with 'is' and 'is 
  not.'&quot;<br>
  &quot;How can living beings in the three realms of existence on the level of 
  worldliness and the Sound-hearers and those enlightened to conditions on the 
  level of transcendence make suppositions about the supreme Bodhi of the Thus 
  Come One with the winds that they know of, or enter the knowledge and vision 
  of the Buddha through the medium of worldly language and expressions?<br>
  &quot;For example, lutes, flutes, and guitars can make wonderful sounds, but 
  if there are no skilled fingers to play them, their music will never come forth.<br>
  &quot;You and all living beings are the same way. The precious, enlightened 
  mind is perfect in everyone. Thus, I press my finger upon it and the ocean-impression 
  emits light; you move your mind, and the wearisome defilements spring up.<br>
  &quot;It is all because you do not diligently seek the unsurpassed enlightened 
  way, but are fond of the lesser vehicle and are satisfied with little attainment.<br>
  Purna said, &quot;I am non-dual and complete with the Thus Come One's perfect 
  brightness of the precious enlightenment, the true wonder of the pure mind. 
  But long ago I was victimized by false thoughts that have no beginning and I 
  have long endured the turning wheel of rebirth. Now I have attained the sagely 
  vehicle, but it is not yet ultimate. The World Honored One has completely extinguished 
  all falseness and obtained wonderful true permanence.<br>
  &quot;I venture to ask the Thus Come One why all living being exist in falseness 
  and conceal their own wonderful brightness, so that they keep drowning in this 
  deluge?<br>
  The Buddha said to Purna, &quot;Although you have cast off doubts, you still 
  have not ended residual delusions. I will now employ a worldly event in questioning 
  you.<br>
  &quot;Have you not heard of Yajnadatta in Shravasti who on impulse one morning 
  held a mirror to his face and feel in love with the head in the mirror? He gazed 
  at the eyes and eyebrows but got angry because he could not see his own face. 
  He decided he must be a Li Mei ghost. Having lost all his bearings, he ran madly 
  out. What do you think? Why did his person set out on a mad chase for no reason?&quot;<br>
  Purna said, &quot;That person was insane. There's no other reason.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;What reason can you give for calling false the wonderful 
  enlightened bright perfection, the fundamentally perfect bright wonder? If there 
  is a person, then how can you say it is false?<br>
  &quot;All your own false thinking becomes in turn the cause for more. From confusion 
  you accumulate confusion through Kalpa after Kalpa; although the Buddha is aware 
  of it, he cannot counteract it.<br>
  &quot;From such confused causes, the cause of confusion penetrates itself. When 
  one realizes that confusion has no cause, the falseness becomes baseless. Since 
  it never arose, why would you hope for its extinction? One who obtains Bodhi 
  is like a person who awakens to realize the events of a dream; even though his 
  mind is awake and clear, he cannot get hold of the things in the dream and physically 
  display them.<br>
  &quot;How much the more is that the case with something is without a cause and 
  basically non-existent, such as Yajnadatta's situation that day in the city? 
  Was there any reason why he became fearful for his head and went running about? 
  If his madness were suddenly to cease, it would not be that he had obtained 
  his head from someplace outside; and so before his madness ceases, how can his 
  head been lost?<br>
  &quot;Purna, falseness is the same way. How can it exist?<br>
  &quot;All you need do is not to follow discriminations, because none of the 
  three causes arises when the three conditions of the three continuities of the 
  world, living beings, and Karmic retribution are cut off.<br>
  &quot;Then the madness of the Yajnadatta in your mind will cease of itself, 
  and just that ceasing is Bodhi. The supreme, pure, bright mind originally pervades 
  the Dharma realm. It is not something obtained from anyone else. Why, then, 
  labor and toil with marrow and joint to cultivate and be certified?<br>
  &quot;This is to be like the person who has a wish-fulfilling pearl sewn in 
  his clothing without realizing it. Thus he roams abroad in a state of poverty, 
  begging for food and always on the move. Although he is indeed destitute, the 
  pearl is never lost.<br>
  &quot;Suddenly, a wise person shows him the pearl: all his wishes are fulfilling, 
  he obtains great wealth, and he realizes that the pearl did not come from somewhere 
  outside.&quot;<br>
  Ananda then bowed at the Buddha's feet, arose in the great assembly, and said 
  to the Buddha, &quot;The World Honored One now explains that when the three 
  conditions of the Karma of killing, stealing, and lust are cut off, the three 
  causes for them do not arise, then three causes for them do not arise. Then 
  the madness of Yajnadatta in the mind ceases of itself, and just that ceasing 
  is Bodhi. It is not something obtained from anyone else. These clearly are causes 
  and conditions; why, then, does the Thus Come One abruptly reject causes and 
  conditions?<br>
  &quot;It was through causes and conditions that my mind became enlightened, 
  World Honored One, and that is not only true of us who are young in years, of 
  us Sound-hearers who still have to study. Mahamaudgalyayana, Shariputra, and 
  Subhuti, who are now in this assembly and who followed the elder Brahmans, became 
  enlightened and obtained the state of no outflows upon hearing the Buddha expound 
  upon causes and conditions.<br>
  &quot;Now you say that Bodhi does not come from causes and conditions. So the 
  spontaneity that Maskari Goshaliputra and others advocated in Rajagriha then 
  becomes the primary meaning! I only hope you will let fall great compassion 
  and break through my confusion.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;Let us take the case of Yajnadatta in the city: 
  if the causes and conditions of his madness cease, the nature that is not mad 
  will spontaneously come forth. The entire principle of spontaneously and causes 
  and conditions is nothing more than that.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, Yajnadatta's head was spontaneously there, it was a spontaneously 
  part of him. There was never a time when it was not. Why, then, did he suddenly 
  fear that he had no head and start running about madly?&quot;<br>
  &quot;If he naturally had a head and went mad due to causes and conditions, 
  would it not be just as natural for him to lose his head due to causes and conditions?<br>
  &quot;Basically his head was not lost. The madness and fear arose from falseness. 
  There was never and change that took place. Why, then, labor, the point about 
  causes and conditions?<br>
  &quot;If the madness were spontaneous, the madness and fear would be fundamental. 
  Before he went mad, then, where was his madness hidden?<br>
  &quot;If the madness were not spontaneous, and his head were in fact not lost, 
  why did he run about in a state of madness?<br>
  &quot;If you realize that you have a head and recognize the madness of your 
  pursuit, then both spontaneity and causes and conditions become idle theories. 
  That is why I say that the three conditions' ceasing to be is itself the Bodhi 
  mind.<br>
  &quot;The Bodhi mind's being produced and the mind subject to production and 
  extinction's being extinguished is simply production and extinction.<br>
  &quot;The ending of both production and extinction is the effortless way. If 
  there is spontaneity, then clearly it must be that the thought of spontaneity 
  arises and the mind subjects to production and extinction ceases: that, then, 
  is still production and extinction.<br>
  &quot;To call the lack of production and extinction spontaneity is the same 
  as to say that the single substance formed by the combination of all mundane 
  appearances is a mixed and united essence, and that whatever is not mixed and 
  united is basically spontaneous in nature.<br>
  &quot;When spontaneity is devoid of spontaneity, and mixing and uniting are 
  devoid of their unifying quality, so that spontaneity and unity alike are abandoned, 
  and both the abandonment of them and their existence cease to be-that is no 
  idle theory.<br>
  &quot;Bodhi and Nirvana are still so far away that you must undoubtedly pass 
  through Kalpas of bitterness and diligence before you cultivate them and are 
  certified.<br>
  &quot;You can hold in memory the twelve divisions of the sutras spoken by the 
  Buddhas of the ten directions and their pure, wonderful principles as many as 
  the sands of the river Ganges, but it only aids your idle theorizing.<br>
  &quot;You can discuss causes and conditions and spontaneity and understand them 
  perfectly clearly, and people in the world refer to you as the one foremost 
  in learning. You have spent aeons upon aeons saturating yourself with learning, 
  yet you could not avoid the difficulty of Matangi.<br>
  &quot;Why did you have to wait for me to use the spiritual Mantra of the Buddha's 
  Summit? The fire of lust in Matangi's daughter's heart died instantly, and the 
  attained the position of an Anagamin. Now she is one of a vigorous group in 
  my Dharma assembly. The river of love dried up in her, and she was able to set 
  you free.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, Ananda, your ability to keep in mind the Thus Come One's wonderful 
  secret teachings of aeon after aeon is not as good as a single day of no outflow 
  cultivation that is intent upon getting far away from the two worldly sufferings 
  of love and hate.<br>
  &quot;In Matangi's daughter, a former prostitute, love and desire were dispelled 
  by the spiritual power of the Mantra. Now her name in Dharma is Bhikshuni 'Nature.'<br>
  &quot;She and Rahula's mother, Yashodhara both became aware of their past causes 
  and knew that for many Kalpas they had endured the suffering of greed and love. 
  Because they single-mindedly became permeated with the cultivation of the goodness 
  of no outflows, they were both freed from their bonds and received predictions. 
  Why, then, do you cheat yourself and still remain caught up in looking and listening?<br>
  When Ananda and the great assembly heard the Buddha's instruction, their doubts 
  and delusion were dispelled. Their minds awakened to the actual appearance, 
  they experienced &quot;light ease&quot; both physically and mentally, and they 
  obtained what they had never had before.<br>
  Once again he wept, bowed at the Buddha's feet, knelt on both knees, placed 
  his palms together, and said to the Buddha, &quot;The Unsurpassed, Great, Compassionate, 
  Pure, and Precious King has instructed me well, so that, by means of these various 
  causes and conditions, expedients, and encouragements, all of us who were immersed 
  in the sea of suffering have escaped it.&quot;<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, having heard the sound of Dharma like this, I know 
  that the treasury of the Thus Come One, the wonderful, enlightened, bright mind, 
  pervades the ten directions and includes the Thus Come One, the lands of the 
  ten directions, and the pure, precious adornments of the land of the wonderfully 
  enlightened King. Yet, the Thus Come One once again admonishes that erudition 
  is of no merit and is not as good as cultivation.<br>
  &quot;So now I am like a wanderer who suddenly encounters a reigning king who 
  bestows upon him an elegant house. He has obtained a mansion, but there needs 
  to be a door in order for him to enter it.<br>
  &quot;I only hope the Thus Come One will not withhold his great compassion in 
  instructing those of us in the assembly who are covered over by darkness, so 
  that we may renounce the small vehicle and attain at last the Thus Come One's 
  Nirvana without Residue, the fundamental path of resolve, and that he will enable 
  those who still must study to know now how to subdue the age-old seeking of 
  advantage from conditions, to obtain Dharani, and to enter into the knowledge 
  and vision of the Buddha.&quot; Having said this, he made a full prostration, 
  and together with the members of the assembly, he single-mindedly awaited the 
  Buddha's compassionate instruction.<br>
  The World Honored One then took pity on the Sound-hearers and the Condition-enlightened 
  Ones in the assembly-all those who were not yet at ease with the Bodhi mind-and 
  on all living beings to come after the Buddha's extinction during the Dharma-ending 
  age. He revealed the wonderful path of cultivation of the Unsurpassed Vehicle.<br>
  He proclaimed to Ananda and to the great assembly, &quot;If you want to have 
  decisive resolve for Bodhi and not grow weary of the wonderful Samadhi of the 
  Buddha, the Thus Come One, you must first understand the two resolutions regarding 
  initial resolve for enlightenment. What are the two resolutions regarding initial 
  resolve for enlightenment?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, the first resolution is this: if you wish to renounce the position 
  of Sound-hearer and cultivate the Bodhisattva Vehicle, and to enter the knowledge 
  and vision of the Buddha, you must carefully consider whether the resolve on 
  the cause-ground and the enlightenment on the ground of fruition are the same 
  or different.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, it is impossible while on the cause-ground to use the mind subject 
  to production and extinction as the basis for cultivating in quest of the Buddha 
  Vehicle, which is neither produced nor extinguished.<br>
  &quot;For this reason, you should realize that all existing Dharmas in the material 
  world will decay and disappear. Ananda, contemplate the world: what thing is 
  there that will not waste away?<br>
  &quot;But, has anyone ever heard of the disintegration of the void? Why not? 
  It is because the void does not exist, and so it can never be destroyed. <br>
  &quot;While you are in your body, what is solid is of earth, what is moist is 
  of water, what is warm is of fire, and what moves is of wind. Because of these 
  four bonds, your tranquil and perfect, wonderfully enlightened bright mind divides 
  into seeing, hearing, sensation, and cognition. From beginning to end there 
  are the five layers of turbidity.<br>
  &quot;What is meant by 'turbidity?' Ananda, pure water, for instance, is fundamentally 
  clear and clean, whereas dust, dirt, ashes, silt, and the like, are basically 
  solid substances. Such are the properties of the two; their natures are not 
  compatible. Suppose, then, that an ordinary person takes some dirt and tosses 
  it into the pure water. The dirt loses its solid quality and the water is deprived 
  of its transparency. The cloudiness which results is called 'turbidity.' Your 
  five layers of turbidity are similar to it.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, you see that emptiness pervades the ten directions. There is no 
  division between emptiness and seeing. However, although emptiness has no substance 
  and your seeing has no awareness. The two become entangled in a falseness. This 
  is the first layer, called the turbidity of time.<br>
  &quot;Your body appears in full, with the four elements composing its substance, 
  and from this, seeing, hearing sensation, and cognition become firmly defined. 
  Water, fire, wind, and earth fluctuate between sensation and cognition and become 
  entangled in a falseness. This is the second layer, called the turbidity of 
  views.<br>
  &quot;Further, the functions of memory, discrimination, and verbal comprehension 
  in your mind bring into being knowledge and views. From out of them appear the 
  six defiling objects. Apart from the defiling objects there are no appearances. 
  Apart from cognition they have no nature. But they become entangled in a falseness. 
  This is the third layer, called the turbidity of afflictions.<br>
  &quot;And then day and night there is endless production and extinction as your 
  knowledge and views continually wish to remain in the world, while your Kamic 
  patterns constantly move you to various places. This entanglement becomes a 
  falseness, which is the fourth layer, called the turbidity of living beings.<br>
  &quot;Originally, your seeing and hearing were not different natures, but a 
  multitude of defiling objects has divided them until suddenly they became different. 
  Their functions are in opposition. Sameness and difference arise and they lose 
  their identity. This entanglement becomes a falseness, which is the fifth layer, 
  called the turbidity of a lifespan.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, you now want to cause your seeing, hearing, sensation, and cognition 
  to return to and tally with the permanence, bliss, true self, and purity of 
  the Thus Come One.<br>
  &quot;You should first decide what the basis of birth and death is by relying 
  on the perfect, tranquil nature which is neither produced nor extinguished.<br>
  &quot;By means of this tranquility, turn the empty and false production and 
  extinction so that they are subdued and return to the source of enlightenment. 
  The attainment of this source of bright enlightenment, which is neither produced 
  nor extinguished, is the mind on the cause-ground.<br>
  &quot;Then you can completely accomplish the cultivation of and certification 
  to the ground of fruition.<br>
  &quot;Its is like purifying muddy water by placing it in a quiet vessel which 
  is kept completely still and unmoving. The sand and silt settle, and the pure 
  water appears. This is called the initial subduing of the of the guest-dust 
  affliction.<br>
  &quot;The complete removal of the mud from the water is called the eternal severance 
  of fundamental ignorance.<br>
  &quot;When clarity is pure to its essence, then no matter what happens there 
  is no affliction. Everything is on accord with the pure and wonderful virtues 
  of Nirvana.<br>
  &quot;The second resolution is this: if you definitely wish to bring forth the 
  resolve for Bodhi and to be especially courageous and dedicated in your cultivation 
  of the Bodhisattva Vehicle, you must decisively renounce all conditioned appearances.<br>
  &quot;You should carefully consider the origin of affliction and the beginningless 
  creation of Karma and perpetuation of rebirth-who creates it and who endures 
  it?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if in your cultivation of Bodhi you do not carefully consider 
  the origin of affliction, you cannot realize the empty falseness of the sense-organs 
  and sense-objects or the location of delusion. If you don't even know its location, 
  how can you subdue it and reach the level of the Thus Come One?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, consider the ordinary person who wants to untie a knot. If he 
  can't see where the knot is, how can he untie it?<br>
  &quot;But I have never heard that one can obliterate empty space. Why? It is 
  because emptiness has no form or appearance; therefore there are no knots to 
  untie. <br>
  &quot;But now your visible eyes, ears, nose and tongue, as well as your body 
  and mind, are like six thieving matchmakers who plunder the jewels of your household.<br>
  &quot;And, thus, from beginningless time living beings and the world have been 
  bound up together, so that the material world cannot be transcended.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, what is meant by the time and space of living being? 'Time' refers 
  to change and flow; 'Space' refers to location.<br>
  &quot;You should know by now that north, east, south, west, northeast, northwest, 
  southeast, southwest, above and below are space. Past, present, and future are 
  periods of time. There are ten directions in space and three periods of time.<br>
  &quot;All living beings come into being because of false interaction. Their 
  bodies go through changes and they are caught up in time and space.<br>
  &quot;However, although there are ten directions in space, those known in the 
  world as north, south, east, and west are the only ones that can be clearly 
  fixed. Above and below have no position; the intermediates have no definite 
  direction. Determined clearly to be four in number, they are then combined with 
  the three periods of time. Three times four, or, alternately, four times three, 
  make twelve.<br>
  &quot;Increase it three times: itself multiplied by ten and again by ten, to 
  reach the thousands: one thousand two hundred is the greatest possible efficacy 
  of the six organs.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, you can thereby establish their value. For example, the eyes see 
  darkness behind and light in front. The front is totally light; the back is 
  totally dark. With your peripheral vision included, you can see two thirds around 
  at most. Therefore, its capacity can be expressed as an efficacy, which is not 
  complete. One third of its efficacy is without virtue. Know, then, that the 
  eyes have an efficacy of only eight hundred.<br>
  &quot;For example, the ears hear everywhere in the ten directions, without loss. 
  They hear movements, whether far or near, and stillness without bounds. Know, 
  then, that the organ of hearing is complete with an efficacy of twelve hundred.<br>
  &quot;For example, the nose smells odors with each inhalation and exhalation 
  of the breath. It is deficient at the point between the inhalation and exhalation. 
  The organ of smell can be considered to be deficient by one third. Know, then, 
  that the nose has an efficacy of only eight hundred.<br>
  &quot;For example, the tongue can proclaim the entirety of worldly and transcendental 
  wisdom. Although language varies according to locality, the principles go beyond 
  boundaries of any kind. Know, then, that the organ of the tongue is complete 
  with an efficacy of twelve hundred.<br>
  &quot;For example, the body is aware of touch, registering it as pain or pleasure. 
  When it makes contact, it is aware of the thing touched; when in isolation, 
  it has no tactile knowledge of other things. Isolation has a single and contact 
  has a dual aspect. The organ of the body can be considered as deficient by one 
  third. Know, then, that the body has an efficacy of only eight hundred.<br>
  &quot;For example, the mind silently includes all worldly and transcendental 
  Dharmas of the ten directions and the three periods of time. Regardless of whether 
  it be sagely or ordinary, everything is included in its boundlessness. Know, 
  then, that he organ of the mind is complete with an efficacy of twelve hundred.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, now you wish to oppose the flow of desire that leads to birth 
  and death. You should turn back the flow of the organs to reach a state pf neither 
  production nor extinction.<br>
  &quot;You should investigate all of these six functioning organs to see which 
  are uniting, which are isolated, which are deep, which are shallow, which will 
  penetrate perfectly, and which are not perfect.<br>
  &quot;Once you have awakened to the organ which penetrates perfectly, you should 
  thereupon reverse the flow of its beginningless involvement in false Karma. 
  Then you will know the difference between one that penetrates perfectly and 
  one that does not. Then a day and an aeon will be one and the same.<br>
  &quot;I have now revealed to you the fundamental efficacy of the tranquil perfect 
  brightness of these six. This is what the numbers are; it is up to you to select 
  which one to enter. Will explain more to aid your progress in it.<br>
  &quot;The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions cultivated by means of all of 
  the eighteen realms and obtained perfect, unsurpassed Bodhi. All of them were 
  generally adequate.<br>
  &quot;But you are at an inferior level and are not yet able to perfect comfortable 
  wisdom among them, therefore, I shall give you an explanation, so that you will 
  be able to enter deeply into one door.<br>
  &quot;Enter one without falseness, and the six sense-organs will be simultaneously 
  pure.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, how do we oppose the flow, 
  enter deeply into one door, and cause the six organs to simultaneously become 
  pure?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;You have already obtained the fruition of a Shrotaapanna. 
  You have already extinguished the view-delusions of living beings in the three 
  realms, but you do not yet know that your organs have accumulated habits that 
  are without beginning. It is through cultivation that one severs not simply 
  these habits, but also their numerous subtleties as they pass through arisal, 
  dwelling, change, and extinction.<br>
  &quot;You should now contemplate the six organs further: are they one or six? 
  If you say they are one, Ananda, why can't the ears see? Why can't the eyes 
  hear? Why can't the head walk? Why can't the feet talk?<br>
  &quot;If the six organs are definitely six, then as I now explain this subtle, 
  wonderful Dharma-door for you in this assembly, which of your six organs is 
  receiving it?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;I hear it with my ears.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Your ears hear by themselves; what, then does it have 
  to do with your body and mouth? And yet you ask about the principles with your 
  mouth, and your body displays veneration.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you should know that if they are not one, then they must be 
  six. And if they are not six, they must be one. But you can't say that your 
  organs are basically one and six.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, you should know that these organs are neither one nor six. It 
  is from being upside-down and sinking into involvements throughout time without 
  beginning that the theory of one and six has become established. As a Shrotaapanna, 
  you have dissolved the six, but you still have not done away with the one.<br>
  &quot;It is like emptiness fitting into differently shaped vessels. The emptiness 
  is said to be whatever shape the vessel is. But if you get rid of the vessel 
  and look at the emptiness, you will say it is one and the same.<br>
  &quot;But how can that emptiness become alike and different at your convenience? 
  Even less can it be one or not one. Therefore, you should understand that the 
  six receptive functioning organs should be the same way.<br>
  &quot;Seeing occurs because the two appearances of darkness and light, and their 
  like, firmly adhere to quietude in what originally was wonderful perfection. 
  The essence of seeing reflects form and combines with form to become an organ. 
  In its pure state the organ of the eye is the four elements. And yet it takes 
  the name 'Eye-organ' and is shaped like a grape. Of the superficial sense organs 
  and the four defiling objects, this one races out after form.<br>
  &quot;Hearing occurs because the two reverberations of movement and stillness, 
  and their like, firmly adhere to quietude in what originally was wonderful perfection. 
  The essence of hearing reflects sound and re-sounds with sound to become the 
  organ of the ear. In its pure state, the organ of the ear is the four elements. 
  It takes the name 'Ear-organ' and is shaped like a fresh, curled leaf. Of the 
  superficial sense organs and the four defiling objects, this one is loosed upon 
  sound.<br>
  &quot;Smelling occurs because the two appearances of penetration and obstruction, 
  and their like, firmly adhere to quietude in what originally was wonderful perfection. 
  The essence of hearing reflects scents and takes in scent to become the organ 
  of the nose. In its pure state, the organ of the nose is the four elements. 
  It takes the name 'Nose-organ' and is shaped like a double hanging claw. Of 
  the superficial sense organs and the four defiling objects, this one probes 
  out after scents.<br>
  &quot;Tasting occurs because the two blends of blandness and variety, and their 
  like, firmly adhere to quietude in what originally was wonderful perfection. 
  The essence of tasting reflects flavors and becomes entwined with flavors to 
  become the organ of the tongue. In its pure state the organ of the tongue is 
  the four elements. It takes the name 'Tongue-organ' and is shaped like a crescent 
  noon. Of the superficial sense organs and the four defiling objects, this one 
  pursues flavors.<br>
  &quot;Sensation occurs because the two frictions of separation and union, and 
  their like, firmly adhere to quietude in what originally was wonderful perfection. 
  The essence of sensation reflects contact and seizes upon contact to become 
  the organ of the body. In its pure state, the organ of the body is the four 
  elements. It takes the name 'Body-organ' and is shaped like a table. Of the 
  superficial organs and the four defiling objects, this one is compelled by contact.<br>
  &quot;Knowing occurs because the two continuities of production and extinction, 
  and their like, firmly adhere to quietude in what originally was wonderful perfection. 
  The essence of knowing reflects Dharmas and grasps Dharmas to become the organ 
  of the mind. In its pure state, the organ of the mind is the four elements. 
  It takes the name 'Mental cognition' and resembles seeing in a dark room. Of 
  the superficial sense organs and the four defiling objects, this one chases 
  after Dharmas.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, in this way the six organs occur, because that bright enlightenment 
  has brightness added to it, thus they lose their essence and adhere to falseness 
  and create light.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, apart from darkness and light there is no substance to seeing 
  for you now; apart from movement and stillness, there, basically, is no disposition 
  of hearing; without penetration and obstruction, the nature of smelling does 
  not arise; in the absence of variety and blandness, tasting does not occur; 
  lacking separation and union, the sensation of contact is fundamentally no-existent; 
  without extinction and production, knowing is put to rest.<br>
  &quot;You need only not follow the twelve conditioned appearances of movement 
  and stillness, union and separation, blandness and variety, penetration and 
  obstruction, production and extinction, and brightness and darkness.<br>
  &quot;Accordingly, extract one organ from adhesion, free it, and subdue it at 
  its inner core. Once subdued, it will return to inherent truth and radiate its 
  innate brilliance. When that brilliance shines forth, the remaining five adhesions 
  will be freed to accomplish total liberation.<br>
  &quot;Do not follow the knowing and seeing that arise from the objects before 
  you. True brightness does not comply with the sense organs. Yet, lodged at the 
  organs is the revelation of the brightness that permits the mutual functioning 
  of the six organs.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, don't you know that now in this assembly there is Aniruddha, who 
  is blind and yet can see; the Dragon, Upananda, who is deaf and yet can hear; 
  the spirit of the Ganges River, who has no nose and yet smells fragrance; Gavempati, 
  who has an unusual tongue and yet senses flavor; and the spirit, Shunyata, who 
  has no body and yet is aware of contact? In the light of the Thus Come One, 
  this spirit is illumined temporarily as an ethereal essence without any substance. 
  In the same way, there is also Mahakashyapa in this assembly, dwelling in the 
  Samadhi of extinction, having obtained the stillness of a Sound-hearer. He has 
  long since extinguished the mind-organ, and yet he has a perfectly clear knowledge, 
  which is not due to the mental process of thinking.<br>
  &quot;Then, Ananda, after all your organs are completely freed, you will glow 
  with an inner light. All the ephemeral, defiling objects and the material world 
  will thereupon change their appearance like ice, which is melted by hot liquid. 
  In response to your mind, they will transform and become the knowledge and awareness, 
  which is unsurpassed enlightenment.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, it is like an ordinary person who has confined seeing to his eyes. 
  If you suddenly have him close his eyes, he will see darkness before him. The 
  six organs and his head and feet will be enveloped in total darkness. If the 
  person traces the shape of external things with his hands, then even though 
  he cannot see, he will recognize someone's head and feet if he feels them. This 
  knowledge and awareness are the same way.<br>
  &quot;If light is the condition requisite for seeing, then darkness brings the 
  absence of seeing. But to perceive without light means that no dark manifestation 
  can obscure the seeing.<br>
  &quot;Once the organs and objects are eradicated, how can the enlightened brightness 
  not become perfect and wonderful?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, as the Buddha has said, 
  'the resolve for enlightenment on the cause-ground which seeks the eternal must 
  be in mutual accord with the ground of fruition.'<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, the ground of fruition is Bodhi; Nirvana; True Suchness; 
  the Buddha-nature; the Amala-consciousness; the Empty Treasury of the Thus Come 
  One; the Great, Perfect Mirror-wisdom. But although it is called by these seven 
  names, it is pure and perfect, its substance is durable, like royal Vajra, everlasting 
  and indestructible.<br>
  If the seeing and hearing are apart from light and darkness, movement and stillness, 
  and penetration and obstruction and are ultimately devoid of substance, they 
  are then like thoughts apart from sense-objects: they do not exist at all.<br>
  &quot;How can what is ultimately destroyed be a cause by which one cultivates 
  in the hope of obtaining the fruition of the Thus Come One's sevenfold permanent 
  abode?<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, when it is apart from light and darkness, the seeing 
  is ultimately empty, just as when there is no sense-objects, the essence of 
  thought is extinguished.<br>
  &quot;I go back and forth in circles, minutely searching, and basically there 
  is no such thing as my mind or its objects. Just what should be used to seek 
  the unsurpassed enlightenment?<br>
  &quot;The Thus Come One previously said it was a tranquil essence, perfect and 
  eternal. His present contradiction defies belief and is a resort to idle theorizing. 
  How can the Thus Come One's words be true and actual?<br>
  &quot;I only hope the Buddha will let fall his great compassion and will instruct 
  us who do not understand and who are holding on tightly.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;You study and learn much, but you have not yet 
  extinguished outflows. In your mind, you know only the causes of being upside 
  down. But when the true inversion manifests, you really cannot recognize it 
  yet.<br>
  &quot;Lest your sincerity and faith remain insufficient, I will try to make 
  use of an ordinary happening to dispel your doubts.<br>
  Then the Thus Come One instructed Rahula to strike the bell once, and he asked 
  Ananda, &quot;Did you hear that?&quot;<br>
  Ananda and the members of the great assembly all said, &quot;We heard it.&quot;<br>
  The bell ceased to sound, and the Buddha again asked, &quot;Do you hear it now?&quot;<br>
  Ananda and the members of the great assembly all said, &quot;We do not hear 
  it.&quot;<br>
  Then Rahula struck the bell once again. The Buddha again asked, &quot;Do you 
  hear it now?&quot;<br>
  Ananda and the great assembly again said, &quot;We hear it.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha asked Ananda, &quot;What do you hear and what do you not hear?&quot;<br>
  Ananda and the members of the great assembly all said to the Buddha, &quot;When 
  the bell is rung, we hear it. Once the sound of the bell ceases, so that even 
  its echo fades away, we do not hear it.&quot;<br>
  The Thus Come One again instructed Rahula to strike the bell, and he asked Ananda, 
  &quot;Is there sound now?&quot;<br>
  Ananda and the members of the great assembly all said, &quot;There is a sound.&quot;<br>
  After a short time the sound ceased, and the Buddha again asked, &quot;It there 
  a sound now?&quot;<br>
  Ananda and the great assembly answered, &quot;There is no sound.&quot;<br>
  After a moment, Rahula again struck the bell, and the Buddha again asked, &quot;Is 
  there sound now?&quot;<br>
  Ananda and the great assembly said together, &quot;There is sound.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha asked Ananda, &quot;What is meant by 'sound,' and what is meant by 
  'no sound?'&quot;<br>
  Ananda and the great assembly told the Buddha, &quot;When the bell is struck 
  there is sound. Once the sound ceases and even the echo fades away, there is 
  said to be no sound.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda and the great assembly, &quot;Why are you inconsistent 
  in what you say?&quot;<br>
  The great assembly and Ananda then asked the Buddha, &quot;In what way have 
  we been inconsistent?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;When I asked you if it was your hearing, you said it 
  was your hearing. Then, when I asked you if it was sound, you said it was sound. 
  I cannot ascertain from your answers if it is hearing or if it is sound. How 
  can you not say this is inconsistent?&quot;<br>
  &quot;Ananda, when the sound is gone without an echo, you say there is no hearing. 
  If there were really no hearing, the hearing-nature would be extinguished. It 
  would be just like dead wood. If then the bell were sounded again, how would 
  you know?<br>
  &quot;What you know to be there or not there is the defiling object of sound, 
  but could the hearing-nature be there or not be there depending on your perception 
  of its being there or not? If the hearing could really not be there, what would 
  perceive that is was not?<br>
  &quot;And so, Ananda, the sounds that you hear are what are subject to production 
  and extinction, not your hearing. The arising and cessation of sounds cause 
  your hearing-nature to be as if there or not there.<br>
  &quot;You are so upside-down that you mistake sound for hearing. No wonder you 
  are so confused that you take what is everlasting for what is annihilated ultimately, 
  you cannot say that there is no hearing-nature apart from movement and stillness 
  and from obstruction and penetration.<br>
  &quot;Consider a person who falls into a deep sleep while napping on his bed. 
  While he is asleep, someone in his household starts beating clothes or pounding 
  rice. In his dream, the person hears the sound of beating and pounding and takes 
  it for something else, perhaps for the striking of a drum or the ringing of 
  a bell. In the dream he wonders why the bell sounds like stone or wood.<br>
  &quot;Suddenly he awakens and immediately recognizes the sound of pounding. 
  He tells the members of his household, 'I was just having a dream in which I 
  mistook the sound of pounding for the sound of a drum.'<br>
  &quot;Ananda, how can this person in the dream-state remember stillness and 
  motion, opening and closing, and penetrability and obstruction? Yet, although 
  he is physically asleep, his hearing-nature is not drowsy.<br>
  &quot;Even when your body is gone and your light and life move on, how could 
  this nature leave you?<br>
  &quot;But because living beings, from time without beginning, have pursued forms 
  and sounds and have followed their thoughts as they turn and flow, they still 
  are not enlightened to the purity, wonder, and permanence of their nature.<br>
  &quot;They do not accord with what is eternal, but chase after things which 
  are subject to production and extinction. Because of this they are born again 
  and again and become mixed with defilement as they flow and turn.<br>
  &quot;But if they reject production and extinction and uphold true permanence, 
  an everlasting light will appear, and with that, the sense-organs, defiling 
  objects, and consciousnesses will disappear.<br>
  &quot;The appearance of thought becomes defilement; the emotions of the consciousness 
  become filth. If you stay far away from these two, then your Dharma-eye will 
  accordingly become pure and bright. How could you fail to accomplish unsurpassed 
  knowledge and enlightenment?&quot;</b></p>
<p>Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, the Thus Come One has 
  explained the two meanings, yet, as I now contemplate people in the world, I 
  believe that if they try to untie a knot and cannot find its center, they will 
  never get the knot undone.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, I and all the other Sound-hearers in the great assembly 
  who are not beyond study are the same way. From time without beginning we have 
  been accompanied in birth and death by ignorance. We have obtained these good 
  roots of erudition and are said to have left the home-life, yet in fact we act 
  like someone with a recurrent fever.<br>
  &quot;I only hope that you, the greatly compassionate one, will take pity on 
  us. We are sinking and drowning so that to this very day we do not know how 
  our bodies and minds are in knots or how to go about untying them. Your explanation 
  will also enable future living beings who are in suffering and difficulty to 
  avoid the turning wheel and not fall into the three realms of existence.&quot;<br>
  After saying this, he and the entire great assembly made full prostrations. 
  He wept profusely, and with sincere anticipation awaited the unsurpassed instruction 
  of the Buddha, the Thus Come One.<br>
  Then the World Honored One took pity on Ananda and on those in the assembly 
  with something left to study, as well as on living beings of the future, in 
  order to help them transcend the world and become eyes for the future.<br>
  He rubbed the crown of Ananda's head with his Jambunada purple-golden bright 
  hand. Instantaneously, all the Buddhalands in the ten directions quaked in six 
  ways.<br>
  Thus Come Ones as numerous as fine motes of dust, each dwelling in his respective 
  world, emitted a precious light from the crown of his head.<br>
  At one and the same time, their light went from their own countries to the Jeta 
  Grove and anointed the crown of the Thus Come One's head. All in that great 
  assembly obtained what they had never had before.<br>
  Then Ananda and everyone in the great assembly heard the Thus Come Ones as numerous 
  as fine motes of dust throughout the ten directions speak to Ananda with different 
  mouths but in a single voice.<br>
  &quot;Good indeed, Ananda! You wish to recognize your innate ignorance that 
  causes you to turn on the wheel. The origin of the knot of birth and death is 
  simply your six sense organs and nothing else.<br>
  &quot;You also want to understand unsurpassed Bodhi, so that you can quickly 
  realize bliss, liberation, tranquility, and wonderful permanence. It, too, is 
  your six sense organs and nothing else.&quot;<br>
  &quot;Ananda heard these sounds of Dharma, but he did not yet understand in 
  his mind. Bowing his head, he said to the Buddha, &quot;How can that causes 
  me to revolve in the cycle of birth and death and what enables me to gain bliss 
  and wonderful permanence be the six sense organs in both cases and nothing else?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;The sense organs and the objects are of the 
  same source. The bonds and the release are not two. The nature of the consciousnesses 
  is empty and false; it is like strange flowers in space.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, sense-awareness arises because of the sense objects: the appearance 
  of objects exists because of the sense organs. The appearance and the perception, 
  both devoid of a nature, support each other like intertwining reeds.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, you now base your knowledge on awareness and perception; but 
  that is fundamental ignorance. The absence of a view regarding awareness and 
  perception is Nirvana-the true purity of no outflows. How could there by anything 
  else in the midst of it?&quot;<br>
  Then the World Honored One, wishing to restate this meaning, spoke verses, saying:<br>
  &quot;In the true nature, conditioned things are empty. <br>
  They spring from causes, as illusions do. <br>
  Things unconditioned neither rise nor cease. <br>
  Unreal they are, like flowers in space. <br>
  To speak of the false is to reveal the true. <br>
  But both the false and the true are false themselves. <br>
  If there is neither truth nor untruth, <br>
  How can there be perceiver and perceived? <br>
  Between them the two in fact have no nature. <br>
  Thus they are likened to entwining reeds. <br>
  The knots and their release have a common cause. <br>
  The sages' and ordinary people's paths are not two. <br>
  Regard the nature of the intertwined. <br>
  Emptiness, existence both are naught. <br>
  Dark confusion is simply ignorance; <br>
  Bringing it to light is liberation. <br>
  The knots must be untied successively. <br>
  When the six are released, even the one ceases to be. <br>
  Select an organ preferred for perfect penetration; <br>
  Enter the flow and realize proper enlightenment. <br>
  Extremely subtle, the Adana consciousness <br>
  Makes patterns of habit that flow on in torrents. <br>
  Fearing you will confuse the truth with what is not, <br>
  I rarely tell you of all this. <br>
  With your own mind, you grasp at your own mind. <br>
  What is not illusory turns into illusion. <br>
  If you don't grasp, there is no non-illusion. <br>
  If even non-illusion does not arise, <br>
  How can illusory Dharmas be established? <br>
  This is called the Wonderful Lotus Flower, <br>
  The regal Vajra Gem of Enlightenment. <br>
  In this Samapatti that is likened to illusion <br>
  Transcend all study instantly. <br>
  This Abhidharma, incomparable <br>
  Is the single pathway through Nirvana's gate, <br>
  Taken by Bhagavans in all the ten directions.&quot; <br>
  When Ananda and the great assembly heard the unsurpassed, compassionate instruction 
  of the Buddha, the Thus Come One, this harmonious and brilliant Geya verse with 
  its clear and penetrating wonderful principles, their hearts and eyes were opened, 
  and they exclaimed that Dharma such as this had never been before. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  <b>VOLUME 5<br></b>
  Ananda put his palms together, bowed, and said to the Buddha, &quot;Having heard 
  the Buddha's unbounded, greatly compassionate, pure, everlasting, true and actual 
  expression of Dharma, I still have not understood the sequence for releasing 
  the knots such that when the six are untied, the one is gone also. I only hope 
  you will be compassionate, and once again take pity on this assembly and on 
  those of the future, by bestowing the sounds of Dharma on us and wash and rinse 
  away our heavy defilements.&quot;<br>
  Then, upon the lion's throne, the Thus Come One straightened his &quot;Nirvana 
  robes,&quot; arranged his Samghati, took hold of the table made of the seven 
  gems, reached out onto the table with his hand and picked up a flowered cloth 
  given him by the Suyama god.<br>
  Then, as the assembly watched, he tied it into a knot and showed it to Ananda, 
  asking, &quot;What is this called?&quot;<br>
  Ananda and the great assembly answered together, &quot;It's called a knot.&quot;<br>
  Then the Thus Come One tied another knot in the cloth of layered flowers and 
  asked Ananda again, &quot;What is this called?&quot;<br>
  Ananda and the great assembly once again answered together, &quot;It, too, is 
  called a knot.&quot;<br>
  He continued in this pattern until he had tied six knots in the cloth of layered 
  flowers. As he made each knot, he held it up to Ananda and asked, &quot;What 
  is this called?&quot;<br>
  And each time Ananda and the great assembly answered the Buddha in the same 
  way: &quot;It is called a knot.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;When I first tied the cloth, you called it 
  a knot. Since the cloth of layered flowers is basically a single strip, how 
  can you call the second and third ties knots as well?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, this cloth of woven layered 
  flowers is just one piece, but as I consider it, when the Thus Come One makes 
  on tie, it is called a knot. If he were to make a hundred ties, they would be 
  called a hundred knots, how much the more so with this cloth, which has exactly 
  six knots, not seven or five. Why does the Thus Come One allow me to call only 
  the first tie a knot and not the second or third ties?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;You know that this precious cloth of flowers is 
  basically one strip, but when I made six ties in it, you said it had six knots. 
  As you carefully consider this, you will see that the substance of the cloth 
  is the same; it is the knots that make the difference.<br>
  &quot;What do you think? The first knot I tied was called number one. Continuing 
  until I come to the sixth knot, and as I now tie it, is it also number one?&quot;<br>
  &quot;No, World Honored One. If there are six knots, the sixth knot can never 
  be called number one. In all my lives of learning, with all my understanding, 
  how could I now confuse the names of six knots?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;So it is. The six knots are not the same. Consider their 
  origin. They are created from the one cloth. To confuse their order will not 
  go.<br>
  &quot;Your six sense organs are also like this. In the midst of ultimate sameness, 
  conclusive differences arise.<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;You certainly dislike these six knots and would 
  like there to be just one cloth. But how can that be done?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;As long as these knots remain, there will be grounds for 
  argument about what is and what is not. Their existence will lead to such distinctions 
  as this knot not being that knot and that knot not being this one. But if on 
  this day, the Thus Come One unties them all, so that no knots remain, then there 
  will be no 'this' and no 'that.' There will not even be something called 'one.' 
  How much the less can there be six?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;'When the six are untied, the one is gone' is the same 
  meaning.'&quot;<br>
  &quot;Because from beginningless time, your mind and nature have been made wild 
  and rebellious, you have produced false knowledge and views. This falseness 
  continues to arise without respite, and the wearisomeness of these views brings 
  about objective 'Dust.'&quot;<br>
  &quot;It is just like strange flowers appearing when your eyes grow weary of 
  staring. They arise at random without any cause within the tranquil, essential 
  brightness.<br>
  &quot;Everything in the world-the mountains, the rivers, and the great earth, 
  as well as birth, death, and Nirvana-is all just a strange weariness: the upside-down 
  appearance of flowers.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said, &quot;This weariness is the same as the knots. How do we untie 
  them?&quot;<br>
  The Thus Come One took hold of the knotted cloth and pulled on its left end 
  and asked Ananda, &quot;Is this the way to untie it?&quot;<br>
  &quot;No, World Honored One.&quot;<br>
  Then with his hand he pulled on the right end and again asked Ananda, &quot;Is 
  this the way to untie it?&quot;<br>
  &quot;No, World Honored One.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;Now I have pulled it to the left and right 
  with my hand and still have not been able to undo them. What method do you propose 
  for untying them?&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, you must untie the knots 
  from their center. Then they will come undone.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;So it is, so it is, if you want to get them 
  undone, you have to untie them from the center.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, the Buddhadharma I explain arises from causes and conditions. 
  But that is not to grasp at the mixing and uniting of coarse appearances in 
  the world. The Thus Come One understands all worldly and world-transcending 
  Dharmas and knows their fundamental causes and what conditions bring them into 
  being.<br>
  &quot;This is so to the extent that I know how many drops of rain fall in as 
  many worlds away from here as there are dust motes in the Ganges. The same is 
  true for all the things you can see: why the pine is straight, why the brambles 
  are twisted, why the goose is white, why the crow is black-I understand the 
  reasons.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, Ananda, you can select whichever one of the six sense-organs 
  you wish. If the knots of the sense-organs are removed, then the defiling appearances 
  disappear of themselves. All falseness ceases to be. If that is not the true, 
  what do you expect in addition to it?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, I now ask you, can the six knots in the cloth of layered flowers 
  be untied simultaneously and released all at once?&quot;<br>
  &quot;No, World Honored One. The knots were originally made one at a time, how 
  they must be untied one at a time. The substance of the six knots is the same, 
  but they were not made simultaneously, and so now when it is time to release 
  them, how can they be untied simultaneously?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said, &quot;Releasing the six sense-organs is the same way. When 
  the sense-organ begins to be released, one realizes the emptiness of people 
  first. When the nature of that emptiness is fully understood, then one is released 
  from Dharmas. Once one is freed from Dharmas, neither kind of emptiness will 
  arise.<br>
  &quot;This is called the Patience with Non-production attained by the Bodhisattvas 
  by means of Samadhi.&quot;<br>
  Upon receiving the Buddha's instruction, Ananda and the great assembly gained 
  wisdom and awareness that was perfectly penetrating and free of doubt and delusion.<br>
  All at the same time, they placed their palms together, bowed at the Buddha's 
  feet, and he said to the Buddha, &quot;Today our bodies and minds are illumined, 
  and we are happily free from obstruction.<br>
  &quot;We have understood the meaning of the ending of the six and the one. Still, 
  we have not yet gone through to fundamental, perfect penetration.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, we who have floated and floundered our way through 
  aeon after aeon, homeless and orphaned, had no idea, we never imagined that 
  we could meet with the Buddha in such a close relationship. We are like lost 
  infants who have suddenly found their compassionate mother.<br>
  &quot;Because of this, we accomplished the way in this assembly. Yet, the secret 
  words which we received are the same as our basic enlightenment, and so it is 
  the same as if we hadn't even heard them.<br>
  &quot;We only wish the greatly compassionate one will bestow upon the profound 
  secret as the Thus Come One's final instruction.&quot; After saying this he 
  prostrated himself, withdrew, and held himself ready for the secret opportunity 
  as he awaited the Buddha's hidden transmission.<br>
  Then the World Honored One told all those in the assembly who were great Bodhisattvas 
  and great Arhats, their outflows extinguished-&quot;All of you Bodhisattvas 
  and Arhats who are born from within my Dharma and have attained the stage beyond 
  study, I now ask you: when you first brought forth your resolve and become enlightened 
  to the eighteen realms, which one of these brought perfect penetration? Through 
  which expedient did you enter Samadhi?&quot;<br>
  Kaundinya, with the others of the five Bhikshus, arose from his seat, bowed 
  at the Buddha's feet, and said to the Buddha, &quot;When I was in the Deer Park 
  and the Pheasant Garden, I observed the Thus Come One immediately after his 
  accomplishment of the way. Upon hearing the Buddha's voice, I understood the 
  your Four Truths.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks us Bhikshus to speak. I was the first to understand, and 
  the Thus Come One certified me and named me Ajnata. His wonderful sound was 
  both secret and all-pervasive. It was through sound that I became an Arhat.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. As I have been certified to 
  it, sound is the superior means.&quot;<br>
  Upanishad arose form his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the Buddha, 
  &quot;I also saw the Buddha when he first accomplished the way. I learned to 
  contemplate the appearance of impurity until I grew to loathe it and came to 
  understand that the nature of all form is unclean. Bare bones and subtle dust 
  all return to emptiness, and so both emptiness and form are done away with. 
  With this realization, I accomplished the path beyond study.<br>
  &quot;The Thus Come One certified me and named me Upanishad. The object of form 
  came to an end, and wonderful form was both secret and all-pervasive. Thus, 
  it was through the appearance of form that I became an Arhat. The Buddha asks 
  about perfect penetration. As I have been certified to it, form is the superior 
  means.&quot;</b></p>
<p>The Pure Youth, Adorned with Fragrance, arose from his seat, bowed at the 
  Buddha's feet, and said to the Buddha, &quot;I heard the Thus Come One teach 
  me to contemplate attentively all conditioned appearances.<br>
  &quot;After I heard the Buddha's instruction, as I sat in repose in the quiet 
  of a pure dwelling. When I saw the Bhikshus light sinking incense, the fragrant 
  scent quietly entered my nostrils. I contemplated this fragrance: it did not 
  come from the wood; it did not come from emptiness; it did not come from the 
  smoke, and it did not come from the fire. There was no place it came from and 
  no place it went to. Because of this, my discriminating mind was dispelled, 
  and I attained the absence of outflows.<br>
  &quot;The Thus Come One certified me and called me 'Adorned with Fragrance.' 
  Defiling scent suddenly vanished, and wonderful fragrance was both secret and 
  all pervasive. It was through the adornment of fragrance that I became an Arhat.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. As I have been certified to 
  it, the adornment of fragrance is the superior means.&quot;<br>
  The two Dharma-princes, Physician Kings and Superior Physician, and five hundred 
  Braham gods in the assembly arose from their seats, bowed at the Buddha's feet, 
  and said to the Buddha, &quot;From beginningless Kalpas until now, we have been 
  good doctors for the world. In our mouths we have tasted many herbs, wood, metals, 
  and stones of the Saha world, a hundred and eight thousand flavors. We know 
  in detail the bitter, sour, salty, bland, sweet, and pungent flavors, and the 
  like, in all their combinations and inherent changes. We have a thorough knowledge 
  of whether they be cooling or warming, poisonous or non-poisonous.<br>
  &quot;While serving the Thus Come One we came to know that the nature of flavors 
  is not empty and is not existent, nor is it the body or mind, nor is it apart 
  from body and mind. We became enlightened by discriminating among flavors.<br>
  &quot;The Thus Come One sealed and certified us brothers and named us as Bohisattvas 
  Physician King and Superior Physician. Now in the assembly we are Dharma-princes 
  who have ascended to the Bodhisattva level because we became enlightened by 
  means of flavors.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. As we have been certified to 
  it, the cause of flavors is the superior means.&quot;<br>
  Bhadrapala and sixteen awakened lords who were his companions, arose from their 
  seats and bowed at the Buddha's feet. He said to the Buddha:<br>
  &quot;We first heard the Dharma and left the home-life under King of Awesome 
  Sound Buddha. Once, when it was time for the Sangha to bathe, I followed the 
  custom and entered the bathhouse. Suddenly I awakened to the fact that water 
  does not wash away the dust, nor does it cleanse the body. At that point, between 
  the two, I became peaceful, and I attained the state of there being nothing 
  at all.<br>
  &quot;To this day, I have never forgotten that past experience. Having left 
  home with the Buddha, I have gone beyond study. That Buddha named me Bhadrapala. 
  Wonderful touch was revealed, and I accomplished the position of the Buddha's 
  disciple.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. As I have been certified to 
  it, touch is the superior means.&quot;<br>
  Mahakashyapa, Purple-golden Light Bhikshuni, and others arose from their seats, 
  bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the Buddha:<br>
  &quot;In a past Kalpa in this region, I drew near to the Buddha named Sun-moon-lamp, 
  who was then in the world. I heard Dharma from him and cultivated and studied 
  with him. After that Buddha's extinction, I made offerings to his Sharira and 
  lit lamps to continue his light. Purple-golden light gilded the Buddha's image. 
  From that time on, in life after life, my body has always been perfect and has 
  shone with a purple-golden light. The Bhikshuni, purple-golden light, and others 
  make up my retinue, and we all brought forth the resolve for Bodhi at the same 
  time.<br>
  &quot;I contemplated that the world's six sense-objects change and decay; they 
  are but empty stillness. Based on this, I cultivated extinction. Now my body 
  and mind can pass through hundreds of thousands of Kalpas as though they were 
  a finger-snap.<br>
  &quot;Based on the emptiness of Dharmas, I accomplished Arhatship. The World 
  Honored One says that I am foremost in Dhuta practices. Wonderful Dharma brought 
  me awakening and understanding, and I extinguished all outflows. The Buddha 
  asks about perfect penetration. As I have been certified to it, Dharmas are 
  the superior means.&quot;<br>
  Aniruddha arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the Buddha, 
  &quot;When I first left home, I was fond of sleeping all the time. The Thus 
  Come One scolded me and said I was no better than an animal. When I heard the 
  Buddha 's scolding, I wept and upbraided myself. For seven days I did not sleep, 
  and I lost the sight in both my eyes.<br>
  &quot;The World Honored One taught me the Vajra Samadhi of the Delightful Seeing, 
  which illumines and is bright. Although I had no eyes, I could contemplate the 
  ten directions with true and penetrating clarity, just as if I were looking 
  at a piece of fruit in the palm of my hand. The Thus Come One certified me as 
  having attained Arhatship.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. As I have been certified to 
  it, returning the seeing back to its source is the foremost method.&quot;<br>
  Kshudrapanthaka arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to 
  the Buddha:<br>
  &quot;I am deficient in the ability to memorize and do not have much innate 
  intelligence. When I first met the Buddha, I heard the Dharma and left the home-life. 
  But, when I tried to remember one line of a verse by the Thus Come One, I went 
  through a hundred days remembering the first part and forgetting the last, or 
  remembering the last and forgetting the first.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha took pity on my stupidity and taught me to relax and regulate 
  my breath. I contemplated my breath thoroughly to the subtle point in which 
  arising, dwelling, change, and extinction happen in every Kshana.<br>
  &quot;My mind suddenly attained vast non-obstruction, until my outflows were 
  extinguished and I accomplished Arhatship. Beneath the Buddha's seat I was sealed 
  and certified as being beyond study.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. As I have been certified to 
  it, turning the breath back to emptiness is the foremost method.&quot;<br>
  Gavampati arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the Buddha, 
  &quot;I have mouth-Karma created from a past offense. I slighted a Shramana, 
  and in life after life I've had this cow-cud sickness.<br>
  &quot;The Thus Come One taught me the mind-ground Dharma-door of the purity 
  of a single flavor. My thought was extinguished, I entered Samadhi, and contemplated 
  the awareness of flavor as not having a substance and not being a thing. As 
  a result, my mind transcended all worldly outflows.<br>
  &quot;Internally I was freed of body and mind, and externally I abandoned the 
  world. I left the three existences far behind, just like a bird released from 
  its cage. I separated from filth and wiped out defilements, and so my Dharma 
  eye became pure, and I accomplished Arhatship The Thus Come One certified me 
  in person as having ascended to the path beyond study.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. As I have been certified to 
  it, returning flavor and turning awareness around is the superior method.<br>
  Pilindavatsa arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the 
  Buddha:<br>
  &quot;When I first left home to follow the Buddha and enter the way, I often 
  heard the Thus Come One explain that there is nothing in this world that brings 
  happiness. Once, when I was begging in the city, I was reflection on this Dharma-door 
  and did not notice a poisonous thorn on the road until it had pricked my foot. 
  My entire body experienced physical pain, but my mind also and recognized the 
  feeling of pain, I knew that in my pure heart, there was neither pain nor awareness 
  of pain.<br>
  &quot;I also thought, 'Is it possible for one body to have two awareness?' Having 
  reflected on this for a while, my body and mind were suddenly empty. After twenty-one 
  days, my outflows disappeared. I accomplished Arhatship and received certification 
  in person and a confirmation that I had realized the level beyond study.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. As I have been certified to 
  it, purifying the awareness and forgetting the body is the superior method.&quot;<br>
  Subhuti arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the Buddha, 
  &quot;From distant Kalpas until now, my mind has been unobstructed. I remember 
  as many of my past lives as there are sands in the Ganges River. From the beginning, 
  in my mother's womb, I knew emptiness and tranquility, to the extent that the 
  ten directions became empty and I caused living beings to be certified to the 
  nature of emptiness.<br>
  &quot;Having received the Thus Come One's revelation that the enlightened nature 
  is true emptiness-that the nature of emptiness is perfect and bright-I attained 
  Arhatship and suddenly entered into the Thus Come One's sea of magnificent, 
  bright emptiness. With knowledge and views identical with the Buddha, I was 
  certified as being beyond study. In the liberation of the nature of emptiness, 
  I am unsurpassed.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks perfect penetration. As I have been certified to it, all 
  appearances enter into nothingness; nothingness and what becomes nothingness 
  both disappear. Turning Dharmas back to the void is the foremost method.&quot;<br>
  Shariputra arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the 
  Buddha, &quot;From distant Kalpas until the present, my mind and views have 
  been pure. In this way I have undergone as many births as there are grains of 
  sand in the Ganges. As to the various transformations and changes of both the 
  mundane and the transcendental, I am able to understand them at one glance and 
  obtain non-obstruction.<br>
  &quot;Once I met the Kashyapas on the road, and I walked along with the brothers. 
  They spoke about causes and conditions, and I awakened to the boundlessness 
  of my mind.<br>
  &quot;I followed the Buddha and left the home life. My seeing-awareness became 
  bright and perfect, I obtained fearlessness and became an Arhat. As one of the 
  Buddha's elder disciples, I am born from the Buddha's mouth, transformationally 
  born from the Dharma.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. As I have been certified to 
  it, for the mind and the seeing to emit light and for the light to reach throughout 
  knowing and seeing is the foremost method.<br>
  Universal Worthy Bodhisattva arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, 
  and said to the Buddha, &quot;I have been a Dharma prince with as many Thus 
  Come Ones as there are sands in the Ganges. The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions 
  tell their disciples who have the roots of a Bodhisattva to cultivate the Universal 
  Worthy conduct, which is named after me.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, I use my mind to listen and distinguish the knowledge 
  and views of living beings.<br>
  In other regions as many realms away as there are sands in the Ganges, if there 
  is any living being who discovers the conduct of Universal Worthy, I immediately 
  mount my six-tusked elephant and create hundreds of thousands of reduplicated 
  bodies which go to those places. Although their obstacles may be so heavy that 
  they do not see me, I secretly rub their crowns, protect and comfort them, and 
  help them be successful.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. The basic cause I speak of 
  ,in my case, is listening with the mind to discover and distinguish at ease. 
  This is the foremost method.&quot;<br>
  Sundarananda arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the 
  Buddha, &quot;When I first left home and followed the Buddha to enter the way, 
  I received the complete precepts, but my mind was always too scattered for Samadhi, 
  and I could not attain the state of having no outflows. The World Honored One 
  taught Kaushthila and me to contemplate the white spot at the tip of our noses.<br>
  &quot;From the first, I contemplated intently. After three weeks, I saw that 
  the breath in my nostrils looked like smoke when I inhaled and exhaled. My body 
  and mind became bright inside, and I perfectly understood the external world, 
  to the point that everything became empty and pure, like crystal. The smoky 
  appearance gradually disappeared, and the breath in my nostrils became white. 
  <br>
  &quot;My mind opened and any outflows were extinguished. Every inhalation and 
  exhalation of breath was transformed into light which illumined the ten directions, 
  and I attained Arhatship. The World Honored One predicted that in the future 
  I would obtain Bodhi.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. I did it by means of the disappearance 
  of the breath, until eventually the breath emitted light and the light completely 
  extinguished my outflows. This is the foremost method.<br>
  Purnamaitreyaniputra arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said 
  to the Buddha, &quot;For vast Kalpas I have possessed unobstructed eloquence. 
  When I discuss suffering and emptiness I penetrate deeply into the actual appearance, 
  and in the same way, I give subtle, wonderful instruction to the assembly concerning 
  the secret Dharma doors of as many Thus Come Ones as there are sands in the 
  Ganges. I have also obtained fearlessness.<br>
  &quot;The World Honored One knew that I had great eloquence, and so he made 
  use of my voice in turning the wheel of the Dharma. He taught me how to disseminate 
  it. I joined the Buddha to help him turn the wheel. I accomplished Arhatship 
  through the lion's roar. The World Honored One certified me as being foremost 
  in speaking Dharma.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. I used the sound of Dharma 
  to subdue demons and adversaries and melt away my outflows. This is the foremost 
  method.&quot;<br>
  Upali arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the Buddha, 
  &quot;I followed the Buddha in person when he fled the city and left the home-life. 
  I observed the Thus Come One endure six years of diligent asceticism. I watched 
  the Thus Come One subdue all the demons, control adherents of external paths 
  and become liberated from all outflows which were based on worldly desire and 
  greed.<br>
  &quot;I based myself on the Buddha's teaching of percepts, encompassing the 
  three thousand awesome deportments and the eighty thousand subtle aspects. Both 
  my actual Karma and my contributing Karma became pure. My body and mind became 
  tranquil, and I accomplished Arhatship.<br>
  &quot;In the Thus Come One's assembly, I am a governor of the law. The Buddha's 
  himself certified my mind's upholding of the precepts and my genuine cultivation 
  of them. I am considered a leader of the assembly.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. I disciplined the body until 
  the body attained ease and comfort. Then I disciplined the mind until the mind 
  attained penetrating clarity. After that, the body and mind experienced keen 
  and thorough absorption. This is the foremost method.<br>
  Great Maudgalyayana arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said 
  to the Buddha, &quot;Once when I was out on the road begging for food, I met 
  the three Kashyapa brothers-Uruvilva, Gaya, and Nadi-who proclaimed for me the 
  Thus Come One's profound principle of causes and conditions. I immediately brought 
  forth resolve and obtained a great understanding.&quot;<br>
  &quot;The Thus Come One accepted me, and the Kashaya was on my body and my hair 
  fell out by itself. I roamed in the ten directions, having no impeding obstructions. 
  I discovered my spiritual penetrations, which are esteemed as unsurpassed, and 
  I accomplished Arhatship.<br>
  &quot;Not only the World Honored One, but the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions 
  praise my spiritual powers as perfectly clear and pure, masterful, and fearless.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. By means of a spirit-like attention 
  to the profound, the light of my mind was revealed, just as muddy water clears. 
  Eventually it became pure and dazzling. This is the foremost method.&quot;<br>
  Ucchushma came before the Buddha, put his palms together, bowed at the Buddha's 
  feet, and said to the Buddha, &quot;I can still remember how many Kalpas ago 
  I was filled with excessive greed and desire. There was a Buddha in the world 
  named King of Emptiness. He said that people with too much desire turn into 
  a raging mass of fire. He taught me to contemplate the coolness and warmth throughout 
  my entire body.<br>
  &quot;A spiritual light coalesced inside and transformed my thoughts of excessive 
  lust into the fire of wisdom. After that, when any of the Buddha's summoned 
  me, they used the name 'fire-head.'<br>
  &quot;From the strength of the fire-light Samadhi, I accomplished Arhatship. 
  I made a great vow that when each of the Buddha's accomplishes the way, I will 
  be a powerful knight and in person subdue the demons' hatred.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. I used attentive contemplation 
  of the effects of heat in my body and mind, until it became unobstructed and 
  penetrating and all my outflows were consumed. I produced a blazing brilliance 
  and ascended to enlightenment. This is the foremost method.<br>
  The Bodhisattva, &quot;Maintaining the ground,&quot; arose from his seat, bowed 
  at the Buddha's feet and said to the Buddha, &quot;I remember when universal 
  light Thus Come One appeared in the world in the past. I was a Bhikshu who continually 
  worked on making level the major roads, ferry-landings, and the dangerous spots 
  in the ground, where the disrepair might hinder or harm carriages or horses. 
  I did everything from building bridges to hauling sand.&quot;<br>
  &quot;I was diligent in this hard labor throughout the appearance of limitless 
  Buddhas in the world. If there were beings at the walls and gates of the cities, 
  who needed someone to carry their goods, I would carry them all the way to their 
  destination, set the things down, and leave without taking any recompense.<br>
  &quot;When the Buddha Vipashyin appeared in the world. There was a worldwide 
  famine. I would carry people on my back, and no matter how far the distance, 
  I would only accept one small coin. If there was an ox-cart stuck in the mud, 
  I would use my spiritual strength to push the wheels and get it out of difficulty.<br>
  &quot;Once a king asked the Buddha to accept a vegetarian feast. At the time, 
  I served the Buddha by leveling the road as he went. Vipashyin Thus Come One 
  rubbed my crown and said, 'You should level your mind-ground, then everything 
  else in the world would be level.'<br>
  &quot;Immediately my mind opened up and I saw that the particles of earth composing 
  my own body were no different from all the particles of earth that made up the 
  world. The nature of those particles of dust was such that they did not connect 
  with one another nor could they be touched by the blade of a sword.<br>
  &quot;Within the Dharma-nature I awakened to the patience with the non-production 
  of Dharmas and accomplished Arhatship. I brought my mind back, to the extent 
  that I have now entered the ranks of the Bodhisattvas. Hearing the Thus Come 
  One proclaim the Wonderful Lotus Flower, the level of the Buddha's knowledge 
  and vision, I have already been certified as having understood, and am a leader 
  in the assembly.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. Upon attentive contemplation 
  of the body and the environment, I saw that these two dusts are exactly the 
  same-that, fundamentally, everything is the treasury of the Thus Come One, but 
  that an empty falseness arises and creates the dust. When the dust is eliminated, 
  wisdom is perfected, and one accomplishes the unsurpassed Way. This is the foremost 
  method.&quot;<br>
  The Pure Youth Moonlight arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and 
  said to the Buddha, &quot;I remember that long ago, beyond Kalpas as many as 
  there are sands in the Ganges, there was a Buddha in the world named Water-God, 
  who taught all the Bodhisattvas to cultivate the contemplation of water and 
  enter Samadhi.<br>
  &quot;I reflected upon how throughout the body the essence of water is not in 
  discord. I started with mucus and saliva and went on through my body, the nature 
  of water was identical. I saw that the water in my body was not at all different 
  from that in the world outside-even that in royal lands of floating banners 
  with all their seas of fragrant waters.<br>
  &quot;At that time, when I first succeeded in the contemplation of water, I 
  could see only water. I still had not gotten beyond my physical body.<br>
  &quot;I was a Bhikshu then, and once when I was in Dhyana repose in my room, 
  a disciple of mine peeked in the window and saw only pure water there, which 
  filled the entire room. He saw nothing else.<br>
  &quot;The lad was young, and not knowing any better, he picked up a tile and 
  tossed it and into the water. It hit the water with a 'plunk.' He gazed around 
  and then left. When I came out of concentration, I was suddenly aware of a pain 
  in my heart, and I felt like Shariputra must have felt when he met that cruel 
  ghost.<br>
  &quot;I thought of myself, 'I am already an Arhat and have long since abandoned 
  conditions that bring on illness. Why is it that today I suddenly have a pain 
  in my heart? Am I about to lose the position of non-retreat?'<br>
  &quot;Just then, the young lad came promptly to me and related what had happened. 
  I quickly said to him, 'When you see the water again, you may open the door, 
  wade into the water, and remove the tile.' The child was obedient, so that when 
  I re-entered Samadhi, he again saw the water and the tile as well. He opened 
  the door and took it out. When I came out of concentration, my body was as it 
  had been before.<br>
  &quot;I encountered limitless Buddhas and cultivated in this way until the coming 
  of the Thus Come One, King of Masterful Penetrations of Mountains and Seas. 
  Then I finally had no body. My nature and the seas of fragrant waters throughout 
  the ten directions were identical with true emptiness, without any duality or 
  difference. Now I am with the Thus Come One and am known as a Pure Youth, and 
  I have joined the assembly of Bodhisattvas.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. By means of the nature of water, 
  I penetrated through to the flow of a single flavor, and I obtained patience 
  with the non-production of Dharmas and the perfection of Bodhi. This is the 
  foremost method.&quot;<br>
  The Dharma prince Vaidurya Light arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's 
  feet, and said to the Buddha, &quot;I can still remember back through aeons 
  as many as the sands in the Ganges to the time of a Buddha named 'Limitless 
  Sound,' who instructed the Bodhisattvas that fundamental enlightenment is wonderful 
  and bright. He taught them to contemplate this world and all the beings in it 
  as false conditions propelled by the power of wind.<br>
  &quot;At that time, I contemplated the position of the world, and I regarded 
  the passage of time in the world. I reflected on the movement and stillness 
  in my body. I considered the arising of thoughts in the mind. All these kinds 
  of movement were non-dual; they were equal and the same.<br>
  &quot;I then understood that the nature of movement does not come from anywhere 
  and does not go anywhere. Every single material particle throughout the ten 
  directions and every upside-down living being in it is of the same empty falseness.<br>
  &quot;And so, throughout the three-thousand-great-thousand worlds, the living 
  beings in each of the worlds were like so many mosquitoes confined in a trap 
  and droning monotonously. Caught in those few square inches, their hum built 
  to a maddening crescendo. Not long after I encountered the Buddha, I attained 
  patience with the now-production of Dharmas.<br>
  &quot;My mind then opened, and I could see the country of the Buddha, 'unmoving', 
  in the east. I became a Dharma prince and served the Buddhas of the ten directions. 
  My body and mind emit a light that makes them completely clear and translucent.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. I contemplated the power of 
  wind as lacking anything to rely on, and I awakened to the Bodhi-mind. I entered 
  Samadhi and meshed with the single, wonderful mind transmitted by all the Buddhas 
  of the ten directions. This is the foremost method.&quot;<br>
  Treasury of Emptiness Bodhisattva arose from his seat, bowed to the Buddha's 
  feet, and said to the Buddha, &quot;The Thus Come One and I attained boundless 
  bodies at the place of the Buddha, 'Samadhi-Light.'<br>
  &quot;At that time, I held in my hands four huge precious pearls, which shone 
  on Buddhalands as many as the motes of dust in the ten directions and transformed 
  them into emptiness.<br>
  &quot;In my mind there appeared a great, perfect mirror, which emitted from 
  within ten kinds of subtle, wonderful precious light that poured out into the 
  ten directions to the farthest bounds of emptiness.<br>
  &quot;All the royal lands of banners came into the mirror and passed into my 
  body. There was no hindrance to this interaction, because my body was like emptiness.<br>
  &quot;My body could enter with ease as many countries as there are fine motes 
  of dust and could do the Buddha's work on a wide scale, because it had become 
  completely compliant.<br>
  &quot;I achieved this great spiritual power from contemplating in detail how 
  the four elements lack anything to return to; how the production and extinction 
  of false thoughts is no different from emptiness; how all the Buddhalands are 
  basically the same. Once I realized this identity, I obtained patience with 
  the non-production of Dharmas.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. I used the contemplation of 
  the boundlessness of emptiness to enter Samadhi and attain wonderful power and 
  perfect clarity. This is the foremost method.&quot;<br>
  Maitreya Bodhisattva arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said 
  to the Buddha, &quot;I remember when, as many Kalpas ago as there are fine motes 
  of dust, a Buddha named Light-of-Sun-Moon-Lamp appeared in the world. Under 
  that Buddha I left the home life; yet I was deeply committed to worldly fame 
  and liked to fraternize with people of good family.<br>
  &quot;Then the World Honored One taught me to cultivate consciousness-only concentration, 
  and I entered that Samadhi. For many aeons I have made use of that Samadhi as 
  I performed deeds for as many Buddha as there are sands in the Ganges. My seeking 
  for worldly name and fame ceased completely and never recurred.<br>
  &quot;When Burning Lamp Buddha appeared in the world, I finally accomplished 
  the unsurpassed, wonderfully perfect Samadhi of consciousness.<br>
  &quot;I went on until, to the ends of emptiness, all the lands of the Thus Come 
  One, whether pure or defiled, existent or non-existent, were transformations 
  appearing from within my own mind.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, because I understand consciousness-only thus, the nature 
  of consciousness reveals limitless Thus Come One. Now I have received the prediction 
  that I will be the next to take the Buddha's place.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. I was intent upon the contemplation 
  that the ten directions come only from consciousness. When the conscious mind 
  is perfect and bright, one enters the perfection of the real. One leaves behind 
  reliance on others and attachment to incessant calculating and attains the patience 
  with the non-production of Dharmas. This is the foremost method.&quot;<br>
  Dharma Prince, Great Strength, together with fifty-two Bodhisattvas of similar 
  rank, arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the Buddha:<br>
  &quot;I remember when, as many aeons ago as there are sands in the Ganges, a 
  Buddha called Limitless Light appeared in the world. In that same aeon there 
  were twelve successive Thus Come Ones; the last was called Light Surpassing 
  the Sun and Moon. That Buddha taught me the Buddha-recitation Samadhi.<br>
  &quot;Suppose there were a person who always remembers someone else, but the 
  someone else he remembers has entirely forgotten about him. If two such people 
  were to meet, even if they were to see each other, they would not take notice. 
  They would not recognize each other.<br>
  &quot;If two people remember each other until the memory of each is deep, then 
  in life after they will be together like a form and its shadow, and they will 
  never be at odds.<br>
  &quot;Out of pity for living beings, the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions 
  are mindful of them as a mother remembers her child. If the child runs away, 
  of what use is the mother's regard? But if the child remembers his mother in 
  the same way that the mother remembers the child, then in life after life the 
  mother and child will not be far apart.<br>
  &quot;If living beings remember the Buddha and are mindful of the Buddha, certainly 
  they will see the Buddha nor or in the future.<br>
  &quot;They will never be far from the Buddha, and their minds will awaken by 
  themselves, without the aid of expedients.<br>
  &quot;A person who has been near incense will carry a fragrance on his person; 
  it is the same in this case. It is called an adornment of fragrant light.<br>
  &quot;On the causal ground I used mindfulness of the Buddha to enter into patience 
  with the non-production of Dharmas. Now in this world I gather in all those 
  who are mindful of the Buddha and bring them back to the Pure Land.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. I would select none other than 
  gathering in the six organs through continuous pure mindfulness to obtain Samadhi. 
  This is the foremost method.&quot;<br>
  Then Kuan Shih Yin Bodhisattva arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet 
  and said to the Buddha.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, I remember when, as many Kalpas ago as there are sands 
  in the Ganges, there was a Buddha in the world named Contemplating the World's 
  Sounds. It was under that Buddha that I brought forth the Bodhi-resolve. That 
  Buddha taught me to enter Samadhi through a process of hearing and reflecting.<br>
  &quot;Initially, I entered the flow through hearing and forgot objective states. 
  Since the sense-objects and sense-organs were quiet, the two characteristics 
  of movement and stillness crystallized and did not arise. After that, gradually 
  advancing, the hearing and what was heard both disappeared. Once the hearing 
  was ended, there was nothing to rely on, and awareness and the objects of awareness 
  became empty. When the emptiness of awareness reached an ultimate perfection, 
  emptiness and what was being emptied then also ceased to be. Since production 
  and extinction were gone, still extinction was revealed.<br>
  &quot;Suddenly I transcended the mundane and transcendental worlds, and throughout 
  the ten directions a perfect brightness prevailed. I obtained two supreme states.<br>
  &quot;First, I was united above with the fundamental, wonderfully enlightened 
  mind of all the Buddhas of the ten directions, and I gained a strength of compassion 
  equal to that of all the Buddhas, the Thus Come Ones.<br>
  &quot;Second, I was united below with all living beings in the six paths, and 
  I gained a kind regard for all living beings equally.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, because I served and made offerings to the Thus Come 
  One, Kuan Yin, I received from that Thus Come One a transmission of the Vajra 
  Samadhi of all being like an illusion as one becomes permeated with hearing 
  and cultivates hearing. Because I gained a power of compassion identical with 
  that of all with that of all Buddhas, the Thus Come Ones, I became accomplished 
  in thirty-two response-bodies and entered all lands.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, if there are Bodhisattvas who enter Samadhi and vigorously 
  cultivate the extinction of outflows, who have superior understanding and manifest 
  perfected penetration, I will appear in the body of a Buddha and speak Dharma 
  for them, causing them to attain liberation.<br>
  &quot;If there are those who are studying, who are tranquil and have wonderful 
  clarity, who are superior and miraculous and manifest perfection, I will appear 
  before them in the body of a Solitarily Enlightened One and speak Dharma for 
  them, causing them to attain liberation.<br>
  &quot;If there are those who are studying, who have severed the Twelve Causal 
  Conditions, and, having severed the conditions, reveal a supreme nature, and 
  who are superior and wonderful and manifest perfection, I will appear before 
  them in the body of One Enlightened to Conditions and speak Dharma for them, 
  causing them to attain liberation.<br>
  &quot;If there are those who are studying, who have attained the emptiness of 
  the Four Truths, and cultivating the way, have entered extinction, and have 
  a superior nature and manifest perfection, I will appear before them in the 
  body of a Sound-Hearer and speak Dharma for them, causing them to attain liberation.<br>

  them to attain liberation.<br>

  their wish.<br>

  of the world venerate and yield to, I will appear before them in the body of

  who keep themselves lofty and pure, I will appear before them in the body of 
  an Upasaka and speak Dharma for them, enabling them to accomplish their wish.<br>

  handle matters of state decisively, I will appear before them in the body of

  and rules, I will appear before them in the body of a Bhikshu and speak Dharma

  pure precepts, I will appear before them in the body of a Bhikshuni and speak

  them in the body of an Upasaka and speak Dharma for them, enabling them to accomplish

  thought or without thought, who long to be freed from their destiny, I will 
  appear before them in a body like theirs and speak Dharma for them, enabling 
  them to accomplish their wish.<br>
  &quot;This is called the wonderful purity of the thirty-two response-bodies, 
  by which one enters into all lands and accomplishes self-mastery by means of 
  the Samadhi of becoming permeated with hearing and cultivating hearing and by 
  means of the miraculous strength of effortlessness.<br>
  &quot;Also, World Honored One, using this Vajra Samadhi of becoming permeated 
  with hearing and cultivating hearing, and using the miraculous strength of effortlessness, 
  because I have a kind regard equally for all living beings in the six paths, 
  I go throughout the ten directions and the three periods of time and cause all 
  living beings who encounter bodies of mine to receive the meritorious virtue 
  of fourteen kinds of fearlessness.<br>
  &quot;First: because I do not contemplate sounds for my own sake, but rather 
  listen to the sounds of those whom I contemplate, I can enable living beings 
  throughout the ten directions who are suffering and in distress to attain liberation 
  by contemplating their sounds.<br>
  &quot;Second: since my knowledge and views have turned around and come back, 
  I can make it so that if living beings are caught in a raging fire, the fire 
  will not burn them.<br>
  &quot;Third: since contemplation and listening have turned around and come back, 
  I can make it so that if living beings are floundering in deep water, the water 
  cannot drown them.<br>
  &quot;Fourth: since false thinking is cut off, and my mind is without thoughts 
  of killing or harming, I can make it so that if living beings enter the territory 
  of ghosts, the ghosts cannot harm them.<br>
  &quot;Fifth: since I am permeated with hearing and have brought hearing to accomplishment, 
  so that the six sense-organs have dissolved and returned to become identical 
  with hearing, I can make it so that if living beings are about to be wounded, 
  the knives will break into pieces. I can cause swords of war to have no more 
  effect than if they were to slice into water, or if one were to blow upon light.<br>
  &quot;Sixth: when the hearing permeates and the essence is bright, light pervades 
  the Dharma-realm, so that absolutely no darkness remains. I am then able to 
  make it so that, though Yakshas, Rakshasas, Kumbhandas, Pishachas, and Putanas 
  may draw near to living beings, the ghosts will not be able to see them.<br>
  &quot;Seventh: when the nature of sound completely melts away and contemplation 
  and hearing return and enter, so that I am separate from false and defiling 
  sense-objects, I am able to make it so that if living beings are confined by 
  cangues and fetters, the locks will not hold them.<br>
  &quot;Eighth: when sound is gone and the hearing is perfected, an all-pervasive 
  power of compassion arises, and I can make it so that if living beings are traveling 
  a dangerous road, thieves will not rob them.<br>
  &quot;Ninth: when one is permeated with hearing, one separates from worldly 
  objects, and forms cannot rob one. Then I can make it so that living beings 
  with a great deal of desire can leave greed and desire far behind.<br>
  &quot;Tenth: when sound is so pure that there is no defiling object, the sense-organ 
  and the external state are perfectly fused, without any complement and without 
  anything complemented. Then I can make it so that living beings, who are full 
  of rage and hate will leave all hatred.<br>
  &quot;Eleventh: when the dust has gone and has turned to light, the Dharma realm 
  and the body and mind are like crystal, transparent and unobstructed. Then I 
  can make it so that all dark and dull-witted beings whose natures are obstructed-all 
  Atyantikas-are forever free from stupidity and darkness.<br>
  &quot;Twelfth: when matter dissipates and returns to the hearing, then unmoving 
  in the Bodhimanda, I can travel through worlds without destroying the appearance 
  of those worlds. I can make offerings to as many Buddhas, Thus Come Ones, as 
  there are fine motes of dust throughout the ten directions. At the side of each 
  Buddha I become a Dharma prince, and I can make it so that childless living 
  beings throughout the Dharma realm who wish to have sons, are blessed with meritorious, 
  virtuous, and wise sons.<br>
  &quot;Thirteenth: with perfect penetration of the six sense-organs, the light 
  and what is illumined are not two. Encompassing the ten directions, a great 
  perfect mirror stands in the empty treasury of the Thus Come One. I inherit 
  the secret Dharma-doors of as many Thus Come Ones as there are fine motes of 
  dust throughout the ten directions. Receiving them without loss, I am able to 
  make it so that childless living beings throughout the Dharma realm, who seek 
  daughters are blessed with lovely daughters who are upright, virtuous, and compliant 
  and whom everyone cherishes and respects.<br>
  &quot;Fourteenth: in this three-thousand-great-thousand world system with its 
  billons of suns and moons, as many Dharma princes as there are grains of sand 
  in sixty-two Ganges rivers appear in the world and cultivate the Dharma. They 
  act as models in order to teach and transform living beings. They comply with 
  living beings by means of expedients and wisdom, in different ways for each.<br>
  &quot;However, because I have obtained the perfect penetration of the sense-organ 
  and have discovered the wonder of the ear-entrance, after which my body and 
  mind subtly and miraculously included all of the Dharma realm, I am able to 
  make it so that living beings who uphold my name obtain as much merit and virtue 
  as would be obtained by a person who upheld the names of all those Dharma princes 
  who are as many as the grains of sand in sixty-two Ganges rivers.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, there is no difference between the merit of my one 
  name and the merit of those many other names, because from my cultivation I 
  obtained true and perfect penetration.<br>
  &quot;These are called the Fourteen Powers of Bestowing Fearlessness; with them 
  I bless living beings.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, World Honored One, because I obtained perfect penetration and 
  cultivated to certification of the unsurpassed path, I also became endowed with 
  four inconceivable and effortless wonderful virtues.<br>
  &quot;First: as soon as I obtained the miraculous wonder of hearing the mind, 
  the mind became essential and the hearing was forgotten, therefore, there was 
  no distinction between seeing, hearing, sensation, and knowing. I achieved a 
  single, perfect fusion-pure and precious enlightenment. For this reason, I am 
  able to manifest many wonderful appearances and can proclaim boundless secret 
  spiritual mantras.<br>
  &quot;For example, I may make appear one head, three heads, five heads, seven 
  heads, nine heads, eleven heads, and so forth, until there may be a hundred 
  and eight heads, a thousand heads, ten thousand heads, or eighty-four thousand 
  Vajra heads;<br>
  &quot;Two arms, four arms, six arms, eight arms, ten arms, twelve arms, fourteen, 
  sixteen, eighteen arms, or twenty arms, twenty-four arms, and so forth until 
  there may be a hundred and eight arms, a thousand arms, ten thousand arms, or 
  eighty-four thousand Mudra arms;<br>
  &quot;Two eyes, three eyes, four eyes, nine eyes, and so forth until there may 
  be a hundred and eight eyes, a thousand eyes, ten thousand eyes, or eighty-four 
  thousand pure and precious eyes, sometimes compassionate, sometimes awesome, 
  sometimes in Samadhi, sometimes displaying wisdom to rescue and protect living 
  beings so that they may attain great self-mastery.<br>
  &quot;Second: because of hearing and consideration, I escaped the six defiling 
  objects, just as a sound leaps over a wall without hindrance. And so I have 
  the wonderful ability to manifest shape after shape and to recite mantra upon 
  mantra. These shapes and these mantras dispel the fears of living beings. Therefore, 
  throughout the ten directions, in as many lands as there are fine motes of dust, 
  I am known as one who bestows fearlessness.<br>
  &quot;Third: because I cultivated fundamental, wonderful, perfect penetration 
  and purified the sense-organ, everywhere I go in any world I can make it so 
  that living beings renounce their physical and material valuables to seek my 
  sympathy.<br>
  &quot;Fourth: I obtained the Buddhas' mind and was certified as having attained 
  the ultimate end, and so I can make offerings of rare treasures to the Thus 
  Come Ones of the ten directions and to living beings in the six paths throughout 
  the Dharma realm.<br>
  &quot;If they seek a spouse, they obtain a spouse. If they seek children, they 
  can have children. Seeking Samadhi, they obtain Samadhi; seeking long life, 
  they obtain long life, and so forth to the extent that if they seek the great 
  Nirvana, they obtain great Nirvana.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha asks about perfect penetration. From the gateway of the ear, 
  I obtained a perfect and illumining Samadhi. The conditioned mind was at ease, 
  and therefore I entered the appearance of flow, and obtaining Samadhi, I accomplished 
  Bodhi. This is the foremost method.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, that Buddha, the Thus Come One, praised me as having 
  obtained well the Dharma-door of perfect penetration. In the great assembly 
  he bestowed a prediction upon me and the name, Kuan Shih Yin.<br>
  &quot;Because my contemplation and listening is perfectly clear throughout the 
  ten directions, the name Kuan Shih Yin pervades all the realms of the ten directions.&quot;<br>
  Then the World Honored One upon the Lion's Throne emitted simultaneously from 
  his five extremities a precious light which shone far throughout the ten directions 
  to anoint the crowns of as many Thus Come Ones and Dharma-prince Bodhisattvas 
  as there are motes of dust.<br>
  All those Thus Come Ones also emitted from their five extremities precious lights 
  which were as numerous as motes of dust and which came from the various directions 
  to anoint the crown of the Buddha as well as the crowns of all the great Bodhisattvas 
  and Arhats in the assembly.<br>
  Groves, trees, pools, and ponds all proclaimed the sound of Dharma. The lights 
  blended and criss-crossed like a jeweled silken net. It was an unprecedented 
  event for everyone in the great assembly, and they all attained the Vajra Samadhi.<br>
  Then the heavens rained down hundreds of precious lotus flowers of variegated 
  combinations of green, yellow, red, and white. All the space in the ten directions 
  turned the colors of the seven gems.<br>
  This Saha world with its mountains, rivers, and great earth disappeared totally, 
  and all that could be seen were lands as numerous as motes of dust coming together 
  as one realm. Pure praises in songs and chants spontaneously pervaded in celebration.<br>
  Then the Thus Come One said to Dharma-prince Manjushri, &quot;You should now 
  contemplate these twenty-five great Bodhisattvas and Arhats who are beyond study.<br>
  &quot;Each has explained the initial expedient in his accomplishment of the 
  way. All say they have cultivated to true and actual perfect penetration. Their 
  cultivation is equal without distinctions of superior and inferior or earlier 
  and later.<br>
  &quot;I now wish to cause Ananda to become enlightened, and so I ask which of 
  twenty-five practices is appropriate to his faculties, and which will be, after 
  my extinction, the easiest expedient door for living beings of this realm to 
  enter in order to accomplish the Bodhisattva vehicle and seek the unsurpassed 
  way.&quot;<br>
  Dharma Prince, Manjushri, receiving the Buddha's compassionate instruction, 
  arose from this seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and, basing himself on the 
  Buddha's awesome spirit, spoke verses to the Buddha.<br>
  &quot;The sea of enlightenment in nature is perfect and clear. <br>
  Complete, distinct Bodhi is miraculous source. <br>
  But when basic brightness shone so that objects appeared, <br>
  With objects' existence, the nature's brilliance ceased. <br>
  Confusion and falseness bring about emptiness. <br>
  Relying on emptiness, time and space take form. <br>
  Thoughts settle, making countries and lands. <br>
  What knows and feels becomes living beings. <br>
  The emptiness created within great enlightenment, <br>
  Is like a single bubble in all the sea. <br>
  Lands like fine dust motes, subject to outflows, <br>
  All come forth out of empty space. <br>
  Just as the bubble bursts, space is no longer there. <br>
  How much the less the three states of being; <br>
  Returning to the source, the nature is not two. <br>
  Many are the entrances through expedients; <br>
  None of them does the sagely nature fail to go through. <br>
  Compliant or adverse, all is expedient. <br>
  First resolve and entering Samadhi <br>
  Come slow or fast as there are different norms. <br>
  Form and thought combined to become the 'dust.' <br>
  Their essence is not discernible. <br>
  How can one use what lacks clarity, <br>
  And expect to gain perfect penetration? <br>
  In sounds, language is intermingled. <br>
  But the meaning in a word, a name, a phrase, <br>
  Is such that no single one can include them all. <br>
  How can this bring perfect penetration? <br>
  Awareness of smells comes through contact with them. <br>
  Apart from them, one does not know that they exist. <br>
  Since sensation of them is not constant, <br>
  How can one reach perfect penetration? <br>
  Flavors are not to us fundamental. <br>
  They only exist when there is something to taste. <br>
  Since this sensation is not perpetual, <br>
  How can one derive perfect penetration? <br>
  Touch becomes clear only when something is touched. <br>
  Without an object there can be no contact. <br>
  With fluctuation between contact and separation, <br>
  How can one gain perfect penetration? <br>
  Dharmas are known as 'internal dust.' <br>
  Reckoned as 'dust,' they are certainly sense objects. <br>
  Involvement of subject and object cannot be pervasive; <br>
  How then can they lead to perfect penetration? <br>
  Although seeing itself is clear and penetrating, <br>
  Making bright what is before one, <br>
  It cannot shine behind. <br>
  Ever reaching only half the four directions, <br>
  How can it manifest perfect penetration? <br>
  The nose's breath penetrates in and out. <br>
  But in the rests between there is no air. <br>
  These interruptions render it inconsistent. <br>
  How can one use it for perfect peneration? <br>
  The tongue is not an organ apart from cause; <br>
  Flavors form the source of its sensation when flavors cease, <br>
  It knows nothing at all. <br>
  How can it attain perfect penetration? <br>
  It is the same for the body as for objects of touch. <br>
  Neither can be regarded as a perfect awareness. <br>
  With defined and limited invisible divisions, <br>
  How can it be used for perfect penetration? <br>
  The mind's knowledge is a mass of deliberations. <br>
  What it perceives is never profound insight. <br>
  Unable to get beyond reflection and thought, <br>
  How can it reveal perfect penetration? <br>
  The seeing-consciousness combines three aspects. <br>
  Probe its origin: it has no appearance <br>
  Since its very substance is variable, <br>
  How can it bring perfect penetration? <br>
  The heart of hearing penetrates the ten directions. <br>
  When borne on the strength of great causes, <br>
  Those of initial resolve cannot enter this way. <br>
  How can one expect to gain perfect penetration? <br>
  Reflecting on the nose is a provisional method. <br>
  It only serves to gather in and settle the mind. <br>
  Once settled, the mind is simply still. <br>
  How can that be perfect penetration? <br>
  Speaking Dharma through the medium of language, <br>
  Is enlightened to by those of former accomplishment. <br>
  But words and phrases are not free of outflows. <br>
  How can this make perfect penetration? <br>
  Refraining from transgressions only controls the body. <br>
  Lacking a body, there is nothing to restrain. <br>
  Since its source is not all-pervasive, <br>
  How can it bring perfect penetration? <br>
  Spiritual penetrations are based on past causes. <br>
  What connections have they with distinguishing Dharmas? <br>
  Conditioned thought is not apart from things. <br>
  How can one attain perfect penetration? <br>
  One may contemplate the nature of earth, <br>
  But it is firm and solid, not penetrable. <br>
  What is conditioned is not the sagely nature. <br>
  How can one use it for perfect penetration? <br>
  &quot;One may contemplate the nature of water, <br>
  But such mental reflection is not the true and real. <br>
  This state of suchness is not an enlightened view. <br>
  How can it give perfect penetration? <br>
  One may contemplate the nature of fire, <br>
  But admitting dislike is not true renunciation. <br>
  This expedient cannot be one for beginners. <br>
  How can one use it for perfect penetration? <br>
  One may contemplate the nature of wind, <br>
  But movement and stillness are not non-dual. <br>
  Duality cannot bring the highest enlightenment. <br>
  How can one expect perfect penetration? <br>
  One may contemplate the nature of emptiness. <br>
  But, its aspect is murky and dull; it lacks awareness. <br>
  What is unaware is different from Bodhi. <br>
  How can it bring perfect penetration? <br>
  One may contemplate the nature of consciousness. <br>
  But one is regarding a consciousness that is not eternal. <br>
  Even the thought of it is empty and false. <br>
  How can it bring perfect penetration? <br>
  All activities are impermanent. <br>
  So, too, mindfulness has its origin in rising and ceasing. <br>
  Since cause and effect go beyond cause and effect, <br>
  How can we use it for perfect penetration? <br>
  I now say this, World Honored One, Buddha, who has revealed the Saha world: 
  <br>
  In this land the true substance of teaching <br>
  Resides in hearing the sounds purely. <br>
  If one wants to attain Samadhi, <br>
  Hearing is the best way to enter. <br>
  Apart from suffering, liberation is found. <br>
  How excellent is he who contemplates the world's sounds! <br>
  Throughout Kalpas as numerous as Ganges' sands, <br>
  He enters Buddhalands as many as fine dust motes. <br>
  Obtaining great power of self-mastery, <br>
  He bestows fearlessness on living beings. <br>
  Wonderful is the sound of Kuan Shih Yin, <br>
  A pure sound, like the ocean's roar. <br>
  He saves the world and brings peace to all within it. <br>
  He has transcended the world, and his attainment is eternal. <br>
  I now make this report, 0 Thus Come One, <br>
  Regarding what Kuan Yin has just explained: <br>
  It is like someone in a quiet place <br>
  When drums are rolled throughout the ten directions, <br>
  Hearing at once the sounds from all ten places. <br>
  This, then, is the actual true perfection. <br>
  The eyes cannot see through solid forms. <br>
  Mouth and nose are much the same. <br>
  The body registers awareness only through contact. <br>
  Tangled in thoughts, the mind lacks clear connections. <br>
  Sounds can be heard even through solid walls. <br>
  One can listen to things both near and far. <br>
  None of the other five organs can match this. <br>
  It, then, is penetration true and real. <br>
  The nature of sounds is based in movement and stillness. <br>
  One hears according to whether there is sound. <br>
  With no sound, there is said to be no hearing. <br>
  But this does not mean that the hearing has no nature. <br>
  In the absence of sound, the nature is not gone. <br>
  Nor does it arise in the presence of sound. <br>
  Entirely beyond production and extinction. <br>
  It is, then, truly everlasting. <br>
  Ever-present, even in dream-thinking, <br>
  It does not disappear when conditions and thought are gone. <br>
  Enlightened, this contemplation transcends cognition, <br>
  Reaching beyond both the body and the mind. <br>
  Now, in the Saha world, the theory of sounds <br>
  Has been proclaimed and understood. <br>
  Living beings are confused about the source of hearing. <br>
  They follow sounds and so they turn and flow. <br>
  Ananda's power to remember was exceptional; <br>
  Nonetheless, he fell prey to a deviant plot. <br>
  Was it not from heeding sounds that he was nearly lost? <br>
  By turning back the flow, one will make no such mistake. <br>
  Ananda, you should listen attentively: <br>
  I rely upon the Buddha's awesome power, <br>
  In describing to you the Vajar King, <br>
  A Samadhi inconceivable of likeness to illusions. <br>
  It is the true mother of all Buddhas. <br>
  You may hear the secret Dharma-doors <br>
  Of Buddhas as numerous as motes of dust, <br>
  But without first renouncing desire and outflows, <br>
  You may amass learning, but you will still make mistakes. <br>
  You concentrate on learning to uphold the Buddha's Dharma. <br>
  Why don't you listen to your own hearing? <br>
  Hearing does not spontaneously arise; <br>
  Because of sound it gets its name. <br>
  But when hearing returns and is free of sound, <br>
  What does one call that which is set free? <br>
  As soon as one sense-organ returns to the source, <br>
  The entire six are liberated.&quot; <br>
  Sight and hearing are like an illusory covering. <br>
  The triple realm, a vision of flowers in space. <br>
  When hearing reverts, the cataract is gone. <br>
  The &quot;dust&quot; gives way to pure and perfect insight. <br>
  When purity is ultimate, the light is penetrating. <br>
  A stillness shines and includes within it all of emptiness. <br>
  Looking at the world from this point of view, <br>
  Everything that happens is just like a dream. <br>
  Matangi's daughter, too, is part of the dream. <br>
  Who was able, then, to physically detain you? <br>
  It is like a puppeteer who plays with shadows, <br>
  And works the dolls to seem as real as people. <br>
  Although one sees them move about freely, <br>
  They are really governed by a set of strings. <br>
  Cease operating the controls and they return to stillness. <br>
  The entire illusion is without a nature. <br>
  The six sense-organs are also thus. <br>
  At first there was one essential brightness. <br>
  Which split into a six-fold combination. <br>
  If but one part ceases and returns, <br>
  All six functions will stop as well. <br>
  In response to a thought, defiling objects vanish, <br>
  Becoming pure and wonderful perfect brightness. <br>
  If there is residual defilement, one must still study. <br>
  When the brightness is ultimate, that is the Tathagata. <br>
  Ananda, and everyone in the great assembly, <br>
  Turn yourselves around and revert the hearing. <br>
  Return the hearing and listen to the self nature <br>
  Till the nature reaches the supreme way. <br>
  That is what perfect penetration really means. <br>
  It is the gateway entered by Buddhas as many as dust motes. <br>
  It is the one path to Nirvana. <br>
  Thus Come Ones of the past perfected this method. <br>
  Bodhisattvas now merge with this total brightness. <br>
  People of the future who study and practice <br>
  Will also rely on this Dharma. <br>
  Through this method I, too, have been certified. <br>
  Kuan Shih Yin Bodhisattva was not alone in using it. <br>
  As the Buddha, the World Honored One, requested, <br>
  I choose sincerely a skill-in-means, <br>
  One to save those in the final aeon <br>
  Who seek to escape the mundane world, <br>
  And perfect the heart of Nirvana: <br>
  The best way is to contemplate the sounds of the world. <br>
  All the other kinds of expedients <br>
  Require the awesome spirit of the Buddha. <br>
  In some cases they bring immediate transcendence, <br>
  But they are not the customary means of practice, <br>
  Spoken for those of shallow and deep roots alike. <br>
  I bow to the Thus Come Ones and the Tripitaka, <br>
  And to those inconceivable ones with no outflows, <br>
  Trusting they will aid those in the future, <br>
  So that no one will doubt this Dharma-door. <br>
  It is an expedient easy to master; <br>
  An appropriate teaching for Ananda <br>
  And for those immersed in the final age. <br>
  They should cultivate this organ of hearing, <br>
  A perfect penetration that surpasses all others. <br>
  It is the way to the true mind.&quot; <br>
  Thereupon, Ananda and all in the great assembly experienced a clarity of body 
  and mind. Having attained such profound instruction, they contemplated the Buddha's 
  Bodhi and Parinirvana like someone who, having travelled far on business, knows 
  that he is on the road home, though he was not returned completely.<br>
  Throughout the entire assembly, the gods, dragons, and all the eightfold division, 
  those of the two vehicles who were not yet beyond study, as well as all the 
  Bodhisattvas of initial resolve, as numerous as the sands in ten Ganges rivers, 
  found their fundamental mind and, far removed form from dust and defilement, 
  attained the purity of the Dharma eye.<br>
  The Bhikshuni named &quot;Nature&quot; attained Arhatship after hearing this 
  verse.<br>
  And limitless beings brought forth a matchless, unequalled resolve for Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  <b>VOLUME 6<br></b>
  Ananda straightened his robes and then bowed in the midst of the assembly and 
  placed his palms together. The tracks of his mind were perfectly clear, and 
  he felt a mixture of joy and sorrow. His intent was to benefit beings in the 
  future as he made obeisance and said to Buddha, &quot;Greatly compassionate 
  World Honored One, I have already awakened and attained this Dharma-door for 
  becoming a Buddha, and I can cultivate it without the slightest doubt. I have 
  often heard the Thus Come One say, &quot;Save others first then save yourself. 
  That is the aspiration of a Bodhisattva. Once your own enlightenment is perfected, 
  then you can enlighten others. That is the way the Thus Come One responds to 
  the world.' Although I am not yet saved. I vow to save all living beings in 
  the Dharma-ending age.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, those living beings will gradually drift away from 
  the Buddha, and there will be as many deviant teachers propounding their methods 
  as there are sands in the Ganges. I want to enable those beings to collect their 
  thoughts and enter Samadhi. How can I cause them to reside peacefully in a Bodhimanda, 
  far from the exploits of demons, and be irreversible in their resolve for Bodhi?&quot;<br>
  At that time, the World Honored One praised Ananda in front of the whole assembly, 
  saying, &quot;Good indeed; how good it is that you have asked how to establish 
  a Bodhimanda and to rescue and protect living beings who are sunk in the morass 
  of the final age. Listen well, now, and I will tell you.&quot;<br>
  Ananda and the great assembly agreed to uphold the teaching.<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;You constantly hear me explain in the Vinaya that 
  there are three unalterable aspects to cultivation. That is, collecting one's 
  thoughts constitutes the precepts; from the precepts comes Samadhi; and out 
  of Samadhi arises wisdom. Samadhi arises from precepts, and wisdom is revealed 
  out of Samadhi. These are called the 'Three Non-outflow Studies.'<br>
  &quot;Ananda, why do I call collecting one's thoughts the precepts? If living 
  beings in the six paths of any mundane world had no thoughts of lust, they would 
  not have to follow a continual succession of births and deaths.<br>
  &quot;Your basic purpose in cultivating is to transcend the wearisome defilements. 
  But if you don't renounce your lustful thoughts, you will not be able to get 
  out of the dust.<br>
  &quot;Even though one may have some wisdom and the manifestation of Ch'an Samadhi, 
  one is certain of enter demonic paths if one does not cut off lust. At best, 
  one will be a demon king; on the average, one will be in the retinue of demons; 
  at the lowest level, one will be a female demon.<br>
  &quot;These demons have their groups of disciples. Each says of himself that 
  he has accomplished the unsurpassed Way.<br>
  &quot;After my extinction, in the Dharma-ending age, these hordes of demons 
  will abound, spreading like wildfire as they openly practice greed and lust. 
  Claiming to be good knowing advisors, they will cause living beings to fall 
  into the pit of love and views and lose the way to Bodhi.<br>
  &quot;When you teach people in the world to cultivate Samadhi, they must first 
  clear and unalterable instruction on purity given by the Thus Come Ones and 
  the Buddhas of the past, World Honored Ones.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, Ananda, if cultivators of Ch'an Samadhi do not cut off lust, 
  they will be like someone who cooks sand in the hope of getting rice. After 
  hundreds of thousands of aeons, it will still be just hot sand. Why? It wasn't 
  rice to begin with; it was only sand.<br>
  &quot;If you seek the Buddha's wonderful fruition and still have physical lust, 
  then even if you attain a wonderful awakening, it will be based in lust. With 
  lust at the source, you will revolve in the three paths and not be able to get 
  out. Which road will you take to cultivate and be certified to the Thus Come 
  One's Nirvana?<br>
  &quot;You must cut off the lust which is intrinsic in both body and mind. Then 
  get rid of even the aspect of cutting it off. At that point you have some hope 
  of attaining the Buddha's Bodhi.<br>
  &quot;What I have said here is the Buddha's teaching. Any explanation counter 
  to it is the teaching of Papiyan. <br>
  &quot;Future, Ananda, if living beings in the six paths of any mundane world 
  had no thoughts of killing, they would not have to follow a continual succession 
  of births and deaths.<br>
  &quot;Your basic purpose in cultivating Samadhi is to transcend the wearisome 
  defilements. But if you do not renounce your thoughts of killing, you will not 
  be able to get out of the dust.<br>
  &quot;Even though one may have some wisdom and the manifestation of Ch'an Samadhi, 
  one is certain to enter the path of spirits if one does not cease killing. At 
  best, a person will become a mighty ghost; on the average, one will become a 
  flying Yaksha, a ghost leader, or the like; at the lowest level, one will become 
  an earth-bound Rakshasa.<br>
  &quot;These ghosts and spirits have their groups of disciples. Each says of 
  himself that he has accomplished the unsurpassed way.<br>
  &quot;After my extinction, in the Dharma-ending age, these hordes of ghosts 
  and spirits will abound, spreading like wildfire as they argue that eating meat 
  will bring one to the Bodhi way.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, I permit the Bhikshus to eat five kinds of pure meat. This meat 
  is actually a transformation brought into being by my spiritual powers. It basically 
  has no life-force. You Brahmans live in a climate so hot and humid, and on such 
  sandy and rocky land, that vegetables will not grow; therefore, I have had to 
  assist you with spiritual powers and compassion. Because of the magnitude of 
  this kindness and compassion, what you eat that tastes like meat is merely said 
  to be meat; in fact, however, it is not. After my extinction, how can those 
  who eat the flesh of living beings be called the disciples of Shakya?<br>
  &quot;You should know that these people who eat meat may gain some awareness 
  and may seem to be in Samadhi, but they are all great Rakshasas. When their 
  retribution ends, they are bound to sink into the bitter sea of birth and death. 
  They are not disciples of the Buddha. Such people as these kill and eat one 
  another in a never-ending cycle. How can such people transcend the triple realm?<br>
  &quot;When you teach people in the world to cultivate Samadhi, they must also 
  cut off killing. This is the second clear and unalterable instruction on purity 
  given by the Thus Come Ones and the Buddhas of the past, World Honored Ones.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, Ananda, if cultivators of Ch'an Samadhi do not cut off killing, 
  they are like one who stops up his ears and calls out in a loud voice, expecting 
  no one to hear him. It is to wish to hide what is completely evident.<br>
  &quot;Bodhisattvas and Bhikshus who practice purity will not even step on grass 
  in the path-way; even less will they pull it up with their hand. How can one 
  with great compassion pick up the flesh and blood of living beings and proceed 
  to eat his fill?<br>
  &quot;Bhikshus who do not wear silk, leather boots, furs, or down from this 
  country or consume milk, cream, or butter can truly transcend this world. When 
  they have paid back their past debts, they will not have to re-enter the triple 
  realm.<br>
  &quot;Why? It is because when one wears something taken from a living creature, 
  one creates conditions with it, just as when people eat the hundred grains, 
  their feet cannot leave the earth. Both physically and mentally one must avoid 
  the bodies and the by-products of living beings, by neither wearing them nor 
  eating them. I say that such people have true liberation.<br>
  &quot;What I have said here is the Buddha's teaching. Any explanation counter 
  to it is the teaching of Papiyan.<br>
  &quot;Further, Ananda, if living beings in the six paths of any mundane world 
  had no thoughts of stealing, they would not have to follow a continuous succession 
  of births and deaths.<br>
  &quot;Your basic purpose in cultivating Samadhi is to transcend the wearisome 
  defilements. But if you do not renounce your thoughts of stealing, you will 
  not be able to get out of the dust.<br>
  &quot;Even though one way have some wisdom and the manifestation of Ch'an Samadhi, 
  one is certain to enter a devious path if one does not cease stealing. At best, 
  one will be an apparition; on the average, one will become a phantom; at the 
  lowest level, one will be a devious person who is possessed by a 'mei' ghost.<br>
  &quot;These devious hordes have their groups of disciples. Each says of himself 
  that he has accomplished the unsurpassed Way.<br>
  &quot;After my extinction, in the Dharma-ending age, these phantoms and apparitions 
  will abound, spreading like wildfire as they surreptitiously cheat others. Calling 
  themselves good knowing advisors the superhuman Dharmas. Enticing and deceiving 
  the ignorant, or frightening them out of their wits, they disrupt and lay waste 
  to households wherever they go.<br>
  &quot;I teach the Bhikshus to beg for their food in an assigned place, in order 
  to help them renounce greed and accomplish the Bodhi way. The Bhikshus do not 
  prepare their own food, so that, at the end of this life of transitory existence 
  in the triple realm, they can show themselves to be once-returners who go and 
  do not come back.<br>
  &quot;How can thieves put on my robes and sell the Thus Come One, saying that 
  all manner of Karma one creates is just the Buddhadharma? They slander those 
  who have left the home-life and regard Bhikshus who have taken complete precepts 
  as belonging to the path of the small vehicle. Because of such doubts and misjudgments, 
  limitless living beings fall into the unintermittent hell.<br>
  &quot;I say that Bhikshus who after my extinction have decisive resolve to cultivate 
  Samadhi, and who before the images of Thus Come Ones can burn a candle on their 
  bodies, or burn off a finger, or burn even one incense stick on their bodies, 
  will, in that moment, repay their debts from beginningless time past. They can 
  depart from the world and forever be free of outflows. Though they may not have 
  instantly understood the unsurpassed enlightenment, they will already have firmly 
  set their mind on it.<br>
  &quot;If one does not practice any of these token renunciations of the body 
  on the causal level, then even if one realizes the unconditioned, one will still 
  have to come back as a person to repay one's past debts exactly as I had to 
  undergo the retribution of having to eat the grain meant for horses.<br>
  &quot;When you teach people in the world to cultivate Samadhi, they must also 
  cease stealing. This is the third clear and unalterable instruction on purity 
  given by the Thus Come One and the Buddhas of the past, World Honored Ones.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, Ananda, if cultivators of Ch'an Samadhi do not cease stealing, 
  they are like someone who pours water into a leaking cup and hopes to fill it. 
  He may continue for as many aeons as there are fine motes of dust, but it still 
  will not be full in the end.<br>
  &quot;If Bhikshus do not store away anything but their robes and bowls; if they 
  give what is left over from their food-offerings to hungry living beings; if 
  they put their palms together and make obeisance to entire great assembly; if 
  when people scold them they can treat it as praise: if they can sacrifice their 
  very bodies and minds, giving their flesh, bones, and blood to living creatures; 
  and if they do not repeat the non-ultimate teachings of the Thus Come One as 
  though they were their own explanations, misrepresenting them to those who have 
  just begun to study, then the Buddha gives them his seal as having attained 
  true Samadhi.<br>
  &quot;What I have said here is the Buddha's teaching. Any explanation counter 
  to it is the teaching of Papiyan.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, though living beings in the six paths of any mundane world may 
  not kill, steal, or lust either physically or mentally, these three aspects 
  of their conduct thus being perfect, yet if they tell lies, the Samadhi they 
  attain will not be pure. They will become demons of love and views and will 
  lose the seed of the Thus Come One. <br>
  &quot;They say that they have attained what they have not attained, and that 
  they have been certified when they have not been certified. Perhaps they seek 
  to be foremost in the world, the most venerated and superior person. To their 
  audiences they say that they have attained the fruition of a Shrotaapanna, the 
  fruition of a Sakridagemin, the fruition of an Anagamin, the fruition of Arhatship, 
  the Pratyekabuddha vehicle, or the various levels of Bodhisattvahood up to and 
  including the ten grounds, in order to be revered by others and because they 
  are greedy for offerings.<br>
  &quot;These Icchantikas destroy the seeds of Buddhahood just as surely as a 
  tala tree is destroyed if it is chopped down. The Buddha predicts that such 
  people sever their good roots forever and lose their knowledge and vision. Immersed 
  in the sea of the Three Sufferings, they cannot attain Samadhi.<br>
  &quot;I command the Bodhisattvas and Arhats to appear after my extinction in 
  response-bodies in the Dharma-ending age, and to take various forms in order 
  to rescue those in the cycle of rebirth.<br>
  &quot;They should either become Shramanas, white-robed laypeople, kings, ministers 
  or officials, virgin youths or maidens, and so forth, even prostitutes, widows, 
  profligates, thieves, butchers, or dealers in contraband, doing the same things 
  as these kinds of people while they praise the Buddha vehicle and cause them 
  to enter Samadhi in body and mind.<br>
  &quot;But they should never say of themselves, 'I am truly a Bodhisattva'; or 
  'I am truly an Arhat,' or let the Buddha's secret cause leak out by speaking 
  casually to those who have not yet studied.<br>
  &quot;How can people who make such claims, other than at the end of their lives 
  and then only to those who inherit the teaching, be doing anything but deluding 
  and confusing living beings and indulging in a gross false claim?<br>
  &quot;When you teach people in the world to cultivate Samadhi, they must also 
  cease all lying. This is the fourth clear and unalterable instruction on purity 
  given by the Thus Come Ones and the Buddhas of the past, World Honored ones. 
  <br>
  &quot;Therefore, Ananda, one who does not cut off lying is like a person who 
  carves a piece of human excrement to look like Chandana, hoping to make it fragrant. 
  He is attempting the impossible. <br>
  &quot;I teach the Bhikshus that the straight mind is the Bodhimanda and that 
  they should practice the four awesome deportments in all their activities. Since 
  they should be devoid of all falseness, how can they claim to have themselves 
  attained the Dharmas of a superior person?<br>
  &quot;That would be like a poor person falsely calling himself an emperor; for 
  that, he would be taken and executed. Much less should one attempt to usurp 
  the title of Dharma king. When the cause-ground is not true, the effects will 
  be distorted. One who seeks the Buddha's Bodhi in this way is like a person 
  who tries to bite his own navel. Who could possibly succeed?<br>
  &quot;If Bhikshus' minds are as straight as lute-strings, true and real in everything 
  they do, then they can enter Samadhi and never be involved in the deeds of demons. 
  I certify that such people will accomplish the Bodhisattvas' unsurpassed knowledge 
  and enlightenment. <br>
  &quot;What I have said here is the Buddha's teaching. Any explanation counter 
  to it is the teaching of Papiyan.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, you asked about collecting one's thoughts; I have now begun to 
  explain the wonderful method of cultivation for entrance into Samadhi. Those 
  who seek the Bodhisattva way must first be as pure as glistening frost in keeping 
  these four rules of deportment. If one is able to never give rise to anything 
  superfluous, then the three evils of mind and the four of the mouth will have 
  no cause to come forth.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if one does not neglect these four matters, and, further, if one 
  does not pursue forms, fragrances, tastes, or objects of touch, then how can 
  any demonic deeds arise?<br>
  &quot;If there are people who cannot put an end to their habits from the past, 
  you should teach them to single mindedly recite my 'light atop the Buddha's 
  summit' unsurpassed spiritual mantra, mwo he sa dan dwo bwo da la.<br>
  &quot;It is the invisible appearance atop the summit of the Thus Come One. It 
  is the spiritual mantra proclaimed by the Buddha of the unconditioned mind who 
  comes forth from the summit in a blaze of light and sits upon a jeweled lotus 
  flower.<br>
  &quot;What is more, your past lives with Matangi's daughter created accumulated 
  Kalpas of causes and conditions, your habits of fondness and emotional love 
  go back not just one life, nor even just one Kalpa. Yet, as soon as I proclaimed 
  it, she was freed forever from the love in her heart and accomplished Arhatship.<br>
  &quot;That prostitute, who had no intention of cultivating, was imperceptibly 
  aided by that spiritual power and was swiftly certified to the position beyond 
  study; then what about you Sound Hearers in the assembly, who seek the most 
  supreme vehicle and are resolved to accomplish Buddhahood? For you it should 
  be as easy as tossing dust into a favorable wind. What, then, is the problem?<br>
  &quot;Those in the final age who wish to sit in a Bodhimanda must first hold 
  the pure precepts of a Bhikshu. To do so, they must find as their teacher a 
  foremost Shramana who is pure in the precepts. If they do not encounter a member 
  of the Sangha who is truly pure, then it is absolutely certain that their deportment 
  in precepts and rules cannot be accomplished.<br>
  &quot;After accomplishing the precepts, they should put on fresh, clean clothes, 
  light incense in a place where they are alone, and recite the spiritual mantra 
  spoken by the Buddha of the mind one hundred and eight times. After that, they 
  should secure the boundaries and establish the Bodhimanda.<br>
  &quot;In the countries within them, they should seek for the unsurpassed Thus 
  Come Ones throughout the ten directions to emit a light of great compassion 
  and anoint the crowns of their heads.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, when any such pure Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, or white-robed donors 
  in the Dharma-ending age who can rid their minds of greed and lust hold the 
  Buddha's pure precepts, and in a Bodhimanda make the vows of a Bodhisattva and 
  can bathe upon entering each time, and day and night for three weeks without 
  sleep continue this practice of the way, I will appear before these people in 
  a physically form and rub the crowns of their heads to comfort them and enable 
  them to become enlightened.&quot;<br>
  Ananda said to the Buddha, &quot;World Honored One, enveloped in the Thus Come 
  One's unsurpassed, compassionate instruction, my mind has already become enlightened, 
  and I know how to cultivate and be certified to the way beyond study. But for 
  those who cultivate in the final age and want to establish a Bodhimanda: how 
  do they secure the boundaries in accord with the rules of purity of the Buddha, 
  the World Honored One?&quot; <br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;If there are people in the Dharma-ending age 
  who wish to establish a Bodhimanda, they should first find a powerful white 
  ox in snowy mountains, one which eats the lush and fertile sweet-smelling grasses 
  of the mountain. Since such an ox also drinks only the pure water of the snowy 
  mountains, its excrement will be very fine. They can take that excrement, mix 
  it with Chandana, and plaster the ground with it.<br>
  &quot;If it is not in the snowy mountains, the ox's excrement will stink and 
  cannot be used to smear on the ground. In that case, select a level place, dig 
  down five feet or so, and use that yellow earth.<br>
  &quot;Mix it with Chandana incense, sinking-in-water incense, jasmine incense, 
  continuously permeating incense, burnished gold incense, white paste incense, 
  green wood incense, fragrant mound incense, sweet pine incense, and chicken-tongue 
  incense. Grind these ten ingredients to a fine powder, make a paste, and smear 
  it on the ground of the platform. The area should be sixteen feet wide and octagonal 
  in shape.<br>
  &quot;In the center of the platform, place a lotus flower made of gold, sliver, 
  copper, or wood. In the middle of the flower set a bowl in which dew that has 
  collected in the eighth lunar month has been poured. Let an abundance of flower 
  petals float on the water. Arrange eight circular mirrors in each direction 
  around the flower and the bowl. Outside the mirrors place sixteen lotus flowers 
  and sixteen censers, so that the incense-burners are adorned and arranged between 
  the flowers. Burn only sinking-in-water incense, and do not let the fire be 
  'seen.'<br>
  &quot;Place the milk of a white ox in sixteen vessels, along with cakes made 
  with the milk, rock-candy, oil-cakes, porridge, Turushka, honeyed ginger, clarified 
  butter, and filtered honey. These sixteen are set around the outside of the 
  sixteen flowers as an offering to the Buddhas and great Bodhisattvas.<br>
  &quot;At every mealtime and at midnight, prepare a half-pint of honey and three 
  tenths of a pint of clarified butter. Set up a small incense burner in front 
  of the platform. Decoct the fragrant liquid from the Turushka incense and use 
  it to cleanse the coals. Light them so that a blaze bursts forth, and toss the 
  clarified butter and honey into the flaming censer. Let it burn until the smoke 
  disappears, and present it to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.<br>
  &quot;About the four outside walls one should suspend flags and flowers, and 
  within the room where the platform is located, one should arrange on the four 
  walls images of the Thus Come Ones and Bodhisattvas of the ten directions.<br>
  &quot;In the most prominent place, display images of Vairocana Buddha, Shakyamuni 
  Buddha, Maitreya Bodhisattva, Akshobhya Buddha, Amitabha Buddha, and all the 
  magnificent transformations of Kuan Yin Bodhisattva. To the left and right, 
  place the Vajra-treasury Bodhisattvas. Beside them display the lords Shakra 
  and Brahma, Ucchushma, and the Blue Dirgha, as well as Kundalin and Bhrukuti 
  and all Four Heavenly Kings, with Vinayaka to the left and right of the door.<br>
  &quot;Then suspend eight mirrors in the space around the platform so that they 
  are exactly opposite the mirrors on the platform. This will allow the reflections 
  in them to interpenetrate ad infinitum.<br>
  &quot;During the first seven days, bow sincerely to the Thus Come Ones of the 
  ten directions, to the great Bodhisattvas, and to the names of the Arhats. Throughout 
  the six periods of the day and night, continually recite the mantra as you circumambulate 
  the platform. Practice the way with a sincere mind, reciting the mantra one 
  hundred and eight times at a stretch.<br>
  &quot;During the second week, direct your intent by making the vows of a Bodhisattva. 
  The mind should never be cut off form them. In my Vinaya I have already taught 
  about vows.<br>
  &quot;During the third week, one holds the Buddha's mantra, Bwo Da La, for twelve 
  hours at a time, with a single intent; and on the seventh day, the Thus Come 
  ones of the ten directions will appear simultaneously. Their light will be mutually 
  reflected in the mirrors and will illumine the entire place; and they will rub 
  one on the crown of one's head.<br>
  &quot;If one cultivates this Samadhi in the Bodhimanda, then even in the Dharma-ending 
  age one can study and practice until one's body and mind are as pure and clear 
  as Vaidurya.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if any one of the Bhikshus's precept transmitting masters or any 
  one of the other Bhikshus practicing with him is not pure, the Bodhimanda as 
  described will not be successful.<br>
  &quot;After three weeks, one sits upright and still for a hundred days. Those 
  with sharp faculties will not arise from their seats and will become Shrotaapannas. 
  Although their bodies and minds have not attained the ultimate fruition of sagehood, 
  they know for certain, beyond exaggeration that they will eventually accomplished 
  Buddhahood.<br>
  &quot;You have asked how the Bodhimanda is established. This is the way it is 
  done.&quot;<br>
  Ananda bowed at the Buddha's feet and said, &quot;After I left the home-life, 
  I relied on the Buddha's affectionate regard. Because I sought erudition, I 
  still have not been certified to the unconditioned.<br>
  &quot;When I encountered that Brahma Heaven Mantra, I was captured by the deviant 
  spell; though my mind was aware, I had to rely on Manjushri Bodhisattva to liberate 
  me. Although I was blessed by the Thus Come One's spiritual mantra of the Buddha's 
  summit and imperceptibly received its strength, I still have not heard it myself.<br>
  &quot;I only hope that the greatly compassionate one will proclaim it again 
  to kindly rescue all the cultivators in this assembly and those of the future 
  who undergo the turning wheel, so that they may become liberated in body and 
  mind by relying on the Buddha's secret sounds.&quot;<br>
  At that moment, everyone in the great assembly bowed as one and stood waiting 
  to hear the Thus Come One's secret divisions and phrases.<br>
  At that time, a hundred brilliant rays sprang from the mound of the flesh on 
  the crown of the World Honored One's head. A thousand-petalled precious lotus 
  arose from amidst those rays. Upon the precious flower sat the Thus Come One's 
  transformation.<br>
  From the crown of its hand, in turn, he emitted ten beams, each composed of 
  a hundred rays of precious light. Every one of those glowing rays shone on lands 
  as many as the sands of ten Ganges rivers, while throughout empty space there 
  were Vajra secret-traces spirits, each holding aloft a mountain and wielding 
  a pestle.<br>
  The great assembly, gazing upward, felt fearful admiration and sought the Buddha's 
  kind protection. Single-mindedly they listened as the Thus Come One in the light 
  at the invisible appearance on the crown of the Buddha's head proclaimed the 
  spiritual mantra:<br>

  &quot;Ananda, this cluster of light atop the crown of the Buddha's head, the 
  secret gatha, syi dan dwo bwo da la, with its subtle, wonderful divisions and 
  phrases, gives birth to all the Buddhas of the ten directions. Because the Thus 
  Come Ones of the ten directions use this mantra-heart, they realize unsurpassed, 
  proper, and all-pervading knowledge and enlightenment.<br>
  &quot;Because the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions take up this mantra-heart, 
  they subdue all demons and control all adherents of outside ways.<br>
  &quot;Because the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions avail themselves of this 
  mantra-heart, they sit upon jeweled lotus-flowers and respond throughout countries 
  as numerous as motes of dust.<br>
  &quot;Because the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions embody this mantra-heart, 
  they turn the great Dharma wheel in lands as numerous as fine motes of dust.<br>
  &quot;Because the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions hold this mantra-heart, 
  they are able to go throughout the ten directions to rub beings on the crowns 
  of their heads and bestow predictions upon not yet realized the fruition, can 
  receive a Buddha's prediction.<br>
  &quot;Because the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions are based in this mantra-heart, 
  they can go throughout the ten directions to rescue beings from such suffering 
  as being in the hells, being hungry ghosts, being animals, or being blind, deaf, 
  or mute, as well as from the suffering of being together with those one hates, 
  from the suffering of being apart from those one loves, from the suffering of 
  not obtaining what one seeks, and from the raging blaze of the five Skandhas. 
  They liberate beings from both large and small accidents. In response to their 
  recitation, difficulty with thieves, difficulty with armies, difficulty with 
  the law, difficulty with imprisonment, difficulty with wind, fire, and water, 
  and difficulty with hunger, thirst, and impoverishment are all eradicated.<br>
  &quot;Because the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions are in accord with this 
  mantra-heart, they can serve good and wise advisors throughout the ten directions. 
  In the four aspects of awesome deportment, they make wish-fulfilling offerings. 
  In the assemblies of as many Thus Come Ones as there are sands in the Ganges, 
  they are considered to be great Dharma Princes.<br>
  &quot;Because the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions practice this mantra-heart, 
  they can gather in and teach their relatives in the directions. Causing those 
  of the Small Vehicle not to be frightened when they hear the Secret Treasury.<br>
  &quot;Because the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions recite this mantra-heart, 
  they realize unsurpassed enlightenment while sitting beneath the Bodhi tree, 
  and they enter Parinirvana.<br>
  &quot;Because the Thus Come Ones of the ten directions transmit this mantra-heart, 
  those to whom they have bequeathed the Buddhadharma can, after their Nirvana, 
  dwell in it completely and uphold it. Being strict and pure about the precepts 
  and rules, they can all obtain purity.<br>
  &quot;If I were to explain this mantra, bwo da la, of the cluster of light atop 
  the crown of the Buddha's head from morning till night in an unceasing sound, 
  without ever repeating any syllable or phrase, I could go on for as many Kalpas 
  as there are sands in the Ganges and still never finish.<br>
  &quot;I also will tell you that this Mantra is called 'the Crown of the Thus 
  Come One.'&quot;<br>
  &quot;All of you with something left to study who have not yet put an end to 
  the cycle of rebirth and yet have brought forth sincere resolve to become Arhats, 
  will find it impossible to sit in a Bodhimanda and be far removed in body and 
  mind from all demonic deeds if you do not hold this Mantra.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, let any living being of any country in any world copy out this 
  Mantra in writing on materials native to his region, such as birch bark, pattra, 
  plain paper, or white cotton cloth, and store it in a pouch containing incense. 
  If that person wears the pouch on his body, or if he keeps a copy in his home, 
  then you should know that even if he understands so little that he cannot recite 
  it from memory, he will not be harmed by any poison during his entire life.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, I will now tell you more about how this Mantra can rescue and 
  protect the world, help people obtain great fearlessness, and bring to accomplishment 
  living beings' transcendental wisdom.<br>
  &quot;You should know that, after my extinction, if there are beings in the 
  Dhama-ending age who can recite the Mantra themselves or teach others to recite 
  it, such people who recite and uphold it cannot be drowned by water, and cannot 
  be harmed by mild or potent poisons. <br>
  &quot;And so it is in every other case, such that they cannot be possessed by 
  any evil mantra or any heavenly dragon, ghost, or spirit, or by any essence, 
  weird creature, or demonic ghost. These people's minds will attain proper reception, 
  so that any spell, any paralyzing sorcery, any poison or poisoning gold, any 
  poison silver, any poison or poisoning gold, any poisoning silver, any plant, 
  tree, insect, or snake, and any of a myriad kinds of poisonous vapors will turn 
  into sweet dew when it enters their mouths.<br>
  &quot;&#133;. No evil stars, and no ghost or spirit that harbors malice in its 
  heart and that poisons people can work its evil on these people. Vinayaka as 
  well as all the evil ghost kings and their retinues will be led by deep kindness 
  to always guard and protect them.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, you should know that eighty -four thousand Nayutas of Ganges' 
  sands of kotis of Vajra Treasury-King Bodhisattvas and their descendants, each 
  with Vajra multitudes as retinue, are ever in attendance, day and night, upon 
  this Mantra.<br>
  &quot;If living beings whose minds are scattered and who have no Samadhi remember 
  and recite the Mantra, the Vajra kings will always surround them. Therefore, 
  good men, that is even more true for those who are decisively resolved upon 
  Bodhi. All the Vajra Treasury-King Bodhisattvas will regard them attentively 
  and secretly hasten the opening of their spiritual consciousness.<br>
  &quot;When that response occurs, those people will be able to remember the events 
  of as many Kalpas as there are grains of sand in eighty-four thousand Ganges 
  rivers, knowing them all beyond any doubt.<br>
  &quot;From that Kalpa onward, through every life until the time they take their 
  last body, they will not be born where there are Yakshas, Rakshsas, Putanas, 
  Kataputanas, Kumbhandas, Pishachas and so whether with form or lacking form, 
  or with thought or lacking thought, or in any such evil place.<br>
  &quot;If these good men read, recite, copy, or write out the Mantra, if they 
  carry it or treasure it, if they make offerings to it, then through Kalpa after 
  Kalpa they will not be poor or lowly, nor will they be born in unpleasant places.<br>
  &quot;If these living beings have never accumulated any blessings, the Thus 
  Come Ones of the ten directions will bestow their own merit and virtue upon 
  these people.<br>
  &quot;Because of that, throughout Asamkhyeyas of ineffable, unspeakable numbers 
  of Kalpas, as many as the Ganges' sands, they are always together with the Buddhas. 
  They are born in the same place, due to their limitless merit and virtue, and, 
  like the Amala fruit-cluster, they stay in the same place, become permeated 
  with cultivation, and are never parted.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, it can enable those who have broken the precepts to regain 
  the purity of the precept-source. It can enable those who have not received 
  the precepts to receive them. It can cause those who are not vigorous to become 
  vigorous. It can enable those who lack wisdom to gain wisdom. It can cause those 
  who are not pure to quickly become pure. It can cause those who do not hold 
  to vegetarianism to become vegetarians naturally.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if good men who uphold this Mantra violated the pure precepts 
  before they received the Mantra, their multitude of offenses incurred by violating 
  the precepts, whether major or minor, can simultaneously be eradicated after 
  they begin to uphold the Mantra.<br>
  &quot;Even if they drank intoxicants or ate the five pungent plants and various 
  other impure things in the past, the Buddhas, Bodhidattvas, Vajras, gods, immortals, 
  ghosts, and spirits will not hold it against them.<br>
  &quot;If they are unclean and wear tattered, old clothes to carry out the single 
  practice and single dwelling, they can be equally pure. Even of they do not 
  set up the platform, do not enter the Bodhimanda, and do not practice the way, 
  but recite and uphold this Mantra, their merit and virtue will be identical 
  with that derived from entering the platform and practicing the Way.<br>
  &quot;If they have committed the Five Rebellious Acts, grave offenses warranting 
  unintermittent retribution, or if they are Bhikshus or Bhikshunis who have violated 
  the four Parajikas or the eight Parajikas, such heavy Karma as this will disperse 
  after they recite this Mantra, like a sand dune that us scattered in a gale, 
  so that not a particle remains.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if living beings who have never repented and reformed any of the 
  obstructive offenses, either heavy or light, that they have committed throughout 
  countless Kalpas past, up to and including those of this very life, can nevertheless 
  read, recite, copy, or write out this Mantra or wear it on their bodies or place 
  it in their homes or on their garden houses, then all that accumulated Karma 
  will melt away like snow in hot water. Before long they will obtain awakening 
  to patience with the non-production of Dharmas.<br>
  &quot;More, Ananda, if women who do not have children and want to conceive can 
  sincerely memorize and recite this Mantra or carry the Mantra, syi dan dwo bwo 
  da la, on their bodies, they can give birth to sons or daughters endowed with 
  blessings, virtue, and wisdom.<br>
  &quot;Those who seek long life will obtain long life. Those who seek to quickly 
  perfect their reward will quickly gain perfection. The same is true for those 
  who seek something regarding their bodies, their lives, their appearance, or 
  their strength.<br>
  &quot;At the end of their lives, they will gain the rebirth they hope for in 
  whichever of the countries of the ten directions they wish. They certainly will 
  not be born in poorly endowed places, or as inferior people; even less will 
  they be reborn in some odd form.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, if there is famine or plague in a country, province, or village, 
  or if perhaps there are armed troops, brigands, invasions, war, or any other 
  kind of local threat or danger, one can write out this spiritual mantra and 
  place it on the four city gates, or on a Chaitya or on a Dhvaja, and instruct 
  all the people of the country to gaze upon the Mantra, to make obeisance to 
  it, to revere it, and to singlemindedly make offering to it; one can instruct 
  all the citizens to wear it on their bodies or to place it in their homes; and 
  then all such disasters and calamities will completely disappear.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, in each and every country where the people accord with this Mantra, 
  the heavenly dragons are delighted, the winds and rains are seasonal, the crops 
  are abundant, and the people are peaceful and happy.<br>
  &quot;It can also suppress all evil stars which may appear in any of the directions 
  and transform themselves in uncanny ways. Calamities and obstructions will not 
  arise. People will not die accidentally or unexpectedly. Nor will they be bound 
  by fetters, cangues, or locks. Day and night they will be at peace, and no evil 
  dreams will disturb their sleep.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, this Saha World has eighty-four thousand changeable and disastrous 
  evil stars. Twenty-eight great evil stars are the leaders, and of these, eight 
  great evil stars are the rules. They take various shapes, and when they appear 
  in the world, they bring disaster and weird happenings upon living beings.<br>
  &quot;But they will all be eradicated wherever there is the Mantra. The boundaries 
  will be secured for twelve Yojanas around, and no evil calamity or misfortune 
  will ever enter in.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, the Thus Come One proclaims this Mantra as one which will protect 
  those of the future who have just begun to study, as well as all cultivators, 
  so that they can attain great tranquility.<br>
  &quot;Even less will any demon, ghost, or spirit, or any enemy, calamity, or 
  misfortune due from former lives that reach back to beginningless time, or any 
  old Karma or past debts come to vex and harm them.<br>
  &quot;As to you and everyone in the assembly who still is studying, and as to 
  cultivators of the future who rely on my platform, hold the precepts in accord 
  with the Dharma, receive the precepts from pure members of the Sangha, and hold 
  this mantra-heart without giving rise to doubts: should such good men as these 
  not obtain mind-penetration in that very body born of their parents, then the 
  Thus Come Ones of the ten directions have lied!&quot;<br>
  When he finished this explanation, measureless hundreds of thousands of Vajra 
  Power-Knights in the assembly came before the Buddha, placed their palms together, 
  bowed, and said, &quot;With sincere hearts we will protect those who cultivate 
  Bodhi in this way, according to what the Buddha has said.&quot;<br>
  Then the Brahma King, the God Shakra, and the Four Great Heavenly Kings all 
  came before the Buddha, made obeisance together, and said to Buddha, &quot;If 
  indeed there be good men who cultivate and study in this way, we will do all 
  we can to earnestly protect them and cause everything to be as they would wish 
  throughout their entire lives.&quot;<br>
  Moreover measureless great Yaksha generals, Rakshasa kings, Putana kings, Kumbhanda 
  kings, Pishacha kings, Vinayaka, the great ghost kings, and all the ghost commanders 
  came before the Buddha, put their palms together, and made obeisance. &quot;We 
  also have vowed to protect these people and cause their resolve for Bodhi to 
  be quickly perfected.<br>
  Further, measureless numbers of gods of the sun and moon, lords of the rain, 
  lords of the clouds, lords of thunder, lords of lightning who patrol throughout 
  the year, and all the retinues of stars which were also in the assembly bowed 
  at the Buddha's feet and said to the Buddha, &quot;We also protect all cultivators, 
  so that their Bodhimandas are peaceful and they attain fearlessness.&quot;<br>
  Moreover, measureless numbers of mountain-spirits, sea-spirits, and all those 
  of the earth-the myriad creatures and essences of water, land, and the air-as 
  well as the king of wind-spirits and the gods of the formless heavens, came 
  before the Thus Come One, bowed their heads, and said to the Buddha, <br>
  &quot;We also will protect these cultivators until they attain Bodhi and will 
  never let any demons have their way with them.&quot;<br>
  Then Vajra-Treasury-King Bodhisattvas in the great assembly, numbering as many 
  as eighty-four thousand Nayutas of Kotis' worth of sands in the Ganges, arose 
  from their seats, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the Buddha,<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, the nature of our deeds in cultivation is such that, 
  although we have long since accomplished Bodhi, we do not grasp at Nirvana, 
  but always accompany those who hold this Mantra, rescuing and protecting those 
  in the final age who cultivate Samadhi properly.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, such people as this, who cultivate their minds and 
  seek proper concentration, whether in the Bodhimanda or walking about, and even 
  such people who with scattered minds roam and play in the villages, will be 
  accompanied and protected by us and our retinue of followers.<br>
  &quot;Although the demon kings and the God of Great Comfort will seek to get 
  at them, they will never be able to do so. The smaller ghosts will have to stay 
  ten Yojanas' distance from these good people, except for those beings who have 
  decided they want to cultivate Dhyana.&quot;<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, if such evil demons or their retinues want to harm 
  or disturb these good people, we will smash their heads to smithereens with 
  our Vajra pestles. We will always help these people to accomplish what they 
  want.&quot;<br>
  Then Ananda arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and said to the 
  Buddha, &quot;Now that we who are stupid and slow, who are fond of erudition 
  but have not sought to cease the outflows of our minds, have received the Buddha's 
  compassionate instructions and have attained the proper means to become infused 
  with cultivation, we experience joy in body and mind and obtain tremendous benefit.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, for one who cultivates in this way and is certified 
  as having attained the Buddha's Samadhi, but who has not yet reached Nirvana, 
  what is meant by the level of 'dry wisdom'? What are the 'forty-four minds'? 
  What is the sequence in which one cultivates till one reaches one's goal? What 
  place must one reach to be said to have 'entered the grounds'? And what is meant 
  by a Bodhisattva of 'equal enlightenment'?<br>
  Having said this, he made a full prostration, and then the great assembly singlemindedly 
  awaited the sound of the Buddha's compassionate voice as they gazed up unblinking 
  with respectful admiration.<br>
  At that time the world honored one praised Ananda, saying, &quot;Good indeed, 
  good indeed, that you can for the sake of the entire great assembly and those 
  beings in the final age who cultivate Samadhi and seek the great vehicle, ask 
  to have explained and revealed the unsurpassed proper path of cultivation that 
  takes one from the level of an ordinary person to final Parinirvana. Listen 
  attentively, and I will speak about it for you.&quot; Ananda and everyone in 
  the assembly placed their palms together, cleansed their minds, and silently 
  waited to receive the teaching.<br>
  &quot;The Buddha said, &quot;Ananda, you should know that the wonderful nature 
  is perfect and bright, apart from all names and appearances. Basically there 
  is no world, nor are there any living beings.<br>
  &quot;Because of falseness, there is production. Because of production, there 
  is extinction. The names 'production' and 'extinction' are false.<br>
  &quot;When the false is extinguished, there is truth, which is called the Thus 
  Come One's Unsurpassed Bodhi and Great Nirvana: those are names for two kinds 
  of turning around.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, you now wish to cultivate true Samadhi and arrive directly at 
  the Thus Come One's Parinirvana. First, you should recognize the two upside-down 
  causes of living beings and the world. If this upside-down state is not produced, 
  then there is the Thus Come One's true Samadhi.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, what is meant by the upside-down state of living beings? Ananda, 
  the reason that nature of the mind is bright is that the nature itself is the 
  perfection of brightness. By adding brightness, another nature arises, and from 
  that false nature, views are produced, so that from absolute nothingness comes 
  ultimate existence.<br>
  &quot;All that exists comes from this; every cause in fact has no cause. Subjective 
  reliance on objective appearances is basically groundless. Thus, upon what is 
  fundamentally unreliable, one sets up the world and living beings.<br>
  &quot;Confusion about one's basic, perfect understanding results in the arising 
  of falseness. The nature of falseness is devoid of substances; there is not 
  something which can be relied upon.<br>
  &quot;One may wish to return to the truth, but that wish for the truth is already 
  a falseness. The real nature of True Suchness is not a truth that one can seek 
  to return to. By doing so, one misses the mark.<br>
  &quot;What basically is not produced, what basically does not dwell, what basically 
  is not the mind, and what basically are not Dharmas arise through interaction. 
  As they arise more and more strongly, they form the propensity to create Karma. 
  Similar Karma sets up a mutual stimulus. Because of the Karma thus generated, 
  there is mutual production and mutual extinction. That is the reason for the 
  upside-down state of living beings.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, what is meant by the upside-down state of the world? All that 
  exists comes from this; the world is set up because of the false arising of 
  sections and shares. Every cause in fact has no cause; everything that is dependent 
  has nothing on which it is dependent, and so it shifts and slides and is unreliable. 
  Because of this, the world of the three periods of time and four directions 
  comes into being. Their union and interaction bring about changes, which result 
  in the twelve categories of living beings.<br>
  &quot;That is why, in this world, movement brings around sounds, sounds bring 
  about forms, forms bring about smells, smells bring about contact, contact brings 
  about tastes, and tastes bring about awareness of Dharmas. The random false 
  thinking resulting from these six creates Karma, and this continuous revolving 
  becomes the cause of twelve different categories.<br>
  &quot;And so, in the world, sounds, smells, tastes, contact, and the like, are 
  each transformed throughout the twelve categories to make one complete cycle.<br>
  &quot;The appearance of being upside down is based on this continuous process. 
  Therefore, in the world there are those born form eggs, those born from wombs, 
  those born from moisture, those born by transformation, those with form, those 
  without form, those with thought, those without thought, those not totally endowed 
  with form, those not totally lacking form, those not totally endowed with thought, 
  and those not totally lacking thought.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, through a continuous process of falseness, the upside-down state 
  of movement occurs in this world. It unites with energy to become eighty -four 
  thousand kinds of random thoughts that either fly or sink. From this there come 
  into being the egg Kalalas, which multiply throughout the lands in the form 
  of fish, birds, amphibians, and reptiles, so that their kinds abound.<br>
  &quot;Through a continuous process of defilement, the upside-down state of desire 
  occurs in this world. It unites with stimulation to become eighty-four thousand 
  kinds of random thoughts that are either upright or perverse. From this there 
  come into being the womb Arbudas, which multiply throughout the world in the 
  form of humans, animal, dragons, and immortals until their kinds abound.<br>
  &quot;Through a continuous process of attachment, the upside-down state of inclination 
  occurs in this world. It unites with warmth to become eighty-four thousand kinds 
  of random thoughts that are vacillating and inverted. From this there come into 
  being through moisture the appearance of Peshis, which multiply throughout the 
  lands in the form of insects and crawling invertebrates, until their kinds abound.<br>
  &quot;Through a continuous process of change, the upside-down state of borrowing 
  occurs in this world. It unites with contact to become eighty-four thousand 
  kinds of random thoughts of new and old. From this there come into being through 
  transformation the appearance of Ghanas, which multiply throughout the lands 
  in the form of metamorphic flying and crawling creatures, until their kinds 
  abound.<br>
  &quot;Through a continuous process of restraint, the upside-down state of obstruction 
  occurs in this world. It unites with attachment to become eighty-four thousand 
  kinds of random thoughts of refinement and brilliance. From this there come 
  into being the Ghanas of appearance that possess form, which multiply throughout 
  the lands in the form of auspicious and inauspicious essences, until their kinds 
  abound.<br>
  &quot;Through a continuous process of annihilation and dispersion, the upside-down 
  state a delusion occurs in this world. It unites with darkness to become eighty-four 
  thousand kinds of random thoughts of obscurity and hiding. From this there come 
  into being the Ghanas of formless beings, which multiply throughout the lands 
  as those that are empty, dispersed, annihilated, and submerged until their kinds 
  abound.<br>
  &quot;Through a continuous process of illusory imaginings, the upside-down state 
  of shadows occurs in this world. It unites with memory to become eighty-four 
  thousand kinds of random thoughts that are hidden and bound up. From this there 
  come into being the Ghanas of those with thought, which multiply throughout 
  the lands in the form of spirits, ghosts, and weird essences, until their kinds 
  abound.<br>
  &quot;Through a continuous process of dullness and slowness, the upside-down 
  state of stupidity occurs in this world. It unites with obstinacy to become 
  eighty-four thousand kinds of random thoughts that are dry and attenuated. From 
  this there come into being the Ghanas of those without thought, which multiply 
  throughout the lands as their essence and spirit change into earth, wood, metal, 
  or stone, until their kinds abound.<br>
  &quot;Through a continuous process of parasitic interaction, the upside-down 
  state of simulation occurs in this world. It unites with defilement to become 
  eighty-four thousand kinds of random thoughts of according and relying. From 
  this there come into being the Ghanas of form, which multiply throughout the 
  lands until their kinds abound, in such ways as jellyfish that use shrimp for 
  eyes.<br>
  &quot;Through a continuous process of mutual enticement, the upside-down state 
  of the nature occurs in this world. It unites with mantras to become eighty-four 
  thousand kinds of random thoughts of beckoning and summoning. From this there 
  come into being those not totally lacking form, who take Ghanas which are formless 
  and multiply throughout the lands until their kinds abound, as the hidden beings 
  of mantras and incantations.<br>
  &quot;Through a continuous process of false unity, the upside-down state of 
  transgression occurs in this world. It unites with formations to become eighty-four 
  thousand kinds of random thoughts of reciprocal interchange. From this there 
  come into being those not totally endowed with thoughts, which become Ghanas 
  possessing thought and which multiply throughout the lands until their kinds 
  abound in such forms as the Varata, which turns a different creature into its 
  own species.<br>
  &quot;Through a continuous process of enmity and harm, the upside-down state 
  of killing occurs in this world. It unites with monstrosities to become eighty-four 
  thousand kinds of random thoughts of devouring one's father and mother. From 
  this there come into being those not totally lacking thoughts, who take Ghanas 
  with no thought and multiply throughout the lands, until their kinds abound 
  in such forms as the dirt owl, which hatches its young from clods of dirt, and 
  the p'ou ching bird, which incubates a poisonous fruit to create its young. 
  In each case, the young thereupon eat the parents.<br>

  In each case, the young thereupon eat the parents.<br>
  &quot;These are the twelve categories of living beings.&quot;</b></p>
<p><br>
  <b>VOLUME 7<br></b>
  &quot;Ananda, each of these categories of beings is replete with all twelve 
  kinds of upside-down states, just as pressing on one's eye produces a variety 
  of flower-like images. <br>
  &quot;With the inversion of wonderful perfection, the truly pure, bright mind 
  becomes glutted with false and random thoughts. <br>
  &quot;Now, as you cultivate towards certification to the Samadhi of the Buddha, 
  you will go through three gradual stages in order to get rid of the basic of 
  these random thoughts.<br>
  &quot;They work in just the way that poisonous honey is removed from a pure 
  vessel that is washed with hot water mixed with the ashes of incense. Afterwards 
  it can be used to store sweet dew.<br>
  &quot;What are the three gradual stages? The first is to correct one's habits 
  by getting rid of the aiding causes; the second is to truly cultivate to cut 
  out the very essence of Karmic offenses; the third is to increase one's vigor 
  to prevent the manifestation of Karma.<br>
  &quot;What are aiding causes? Ananda, the twelve categories of living beings 
  in this world are not complete in themselves, but depend on four kinds of eating; 
  that is, eating by portions, eating by contact, eating by thought, and eating 
  by consciousness. Therefore, the Buddha said that all living beings must eat 
  to live.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, all living beings can live if they eat what is sweet, and they 
  will die if they take poison. Beings who seek Samadhi should refrain from eating 
  five pungent plants of this world. <br>
  &quot;If these five are eaten cooked, they increase one's sexual desire; if 
  they are eaten raw, they increase one's anger. <br>
  Therefore, even if people in this world who eat pungent plants can expound the 
  twelve divisions of the sutra canon, the gods and immortals of the ten directions 
  will stay far away from them because they smell so bad. However, after they 
  eat these things the hungry ghosts will hover around and kiss their lips. Being 
  always in the presence of ghosts, their blessings and virtue dissolve as the 
  days go by, and they experience no lasting benefit.<br>
  &quot;People who eat pungent plants and also cultivate Samadhi will not be protected 
  by the Bodhisattvas, gods, immortals, or good spirits of the ten directions; 
  therefore, the tremendously powerful demon kings, able to do as they please, 
  will appear in the body of a Buddha and speak Dharma for them, denouncing the 
  prohibitive precepts and praising lust, rage, and delusion. <br>
  &quot;When their lives end, these people will join the retinue of demon kings. 
  When they use up their blessings as demons, they will fall into the unintermittent 
  hell.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, those who cultivate for Bodhi should never eat the five pungent 
  plants. This is the first of the gradual stages of cultivation.<br>
  &quot;What is the essence of Karmic offense? Ananda, beings who want to enter 
  Samadhi must first firmly uphold the pure precepts.<br>
  &quot;They must sever thoughts of lust, not partake of wine or meat, and eat 
  cooked rather than raw foods. Ananda, if cultivators do not sever lust and killing, 
  it will be impossible for them to transcend the Triple Realm.<br>
  &quot;You should look upon lustful desire as upon a poisonous snake or a resentful 
  bandit. First hold to the Sound-Hearer's four or eight Parajikas in order to 
  control your physical activity; then cultivate the Bodhisattva's pure regulations 
  in order to control your mental activity.<br>
  &quot;When the prohibitive precepts are successfully upheld, one will not create 
  Karma that leads to trading places in rebirth and to killing one another in 
  this world. If one does not steal, one will not be indebted, and one will not 
  have to pay back past debts in this world.<br>
  &quot;If people who are pure in this way cultivate Samadhi, they will naturally 
  be able to contemplate the extent of the worlds of the ten directions with the 
  physical body given them by their parents; without need of the heavenly eye, 
  they will see the Buddhas speaking Dharma and receive in person the sagely instruction. 
  Obtaining spiritual penetrations, they will roam through the ten directions, 
  gain clarity regarding past lives, and will not encounter difficulties and dangers.<br>
  &quot;This is the second of the gradual stages of cultivation.&quot;<br>
  &quot;What is the manifestation of Karma? Ananda, such people as these, who 
  are pure and who uphold the prohibitive precepts, do not have thoughts of greed 
  and lust, and so they do not become dissipated in the pursuit of the six external 
  defiling sense-objects.<br>
  &quot;Because they do not pursue them, they turn around to their own source. 
  Without the conditions of the defiling objects, there is nothing for the sense-organs 
  to match themselves with, and so they reverse their flow, become one unit, and 
  no longer function in six ways.<br>
  &quot;All the lands of the ten directions are as brilliantly clear and pure 
  as moonlight reflected in crystal.<br>
  &quot;Their bodies and minds are blissful as they experience the equality of 
  wonderful perfection, and they attain great peace. <br>
  &quot;The secret perfection and pure wonder of all The Thus Ones appear before 
  them.<br>
  &quot;These people then obtain patience with the Non-production of Dharmas. 
  They thereupon gradually cultivate according to their practices, until they 
  reside securely in the sagely positions.<br>
  &quot;This is the third of the gradual stages of cultivation.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, these good people's emotional love and desire are withered and 
  dry, the sense-organs and sense objects no longer match, and so the residual 
  habits do not continue to arise.<br>
  &quot;By means of their complete wisdom, they understand that the attachments 
  of the mind are false. The bright perfection of their wisdom-nature shines throughout 
  the ten directions, and this initial wisdom is called the 'stage of dry wisdom.'<br>
  &quot;Although the habits of desire are initially dried up, they still have 
  not merged with the Thus Come One's flow of Dharma-water.<br>
  &quot;Then, with this mind centered on the middle, they enter the flow where 
  wonderful perfection reveals itself. From the truth of that wonderful perfection 
  there repeatedly arise wonders of truth. They always dwell in the wonder of 
  faith, until all false thinking is completely eliminated and the Middle Way 
  is totally true. This is called 'the Mind that Resides in Faith.'<br>
  &quot;When true faith is clearly understood, then perfect penetration is total, 
  and the three aspects of Skandhas, places, and realms are no longer obstructions. 
  Then all their habits throughout innumerable Kalpas of past and future, during 
  which they abandon bodies and receive bodies, appear to them now in the present 
  moment. These good people can remember everything and forget nothing. This is 
  called 'the Mind that Resides in Mindfulness'.<br>
  &quot;When the wonderful perfection is completely true, that essential truth 
  brings about a transformation. They go beyond the beginningless habits to reach 
  the one essential brightness. Relying solely on this essential brightness, they 
  progress toward true purity. This is called 'the Mind of Vigor.'<br>
  &quot;The essence of the mind reveals itself as total wisdom; this is called 
  'the Mind that Resides in Wisdom.'<br>
  &quot;As the wisdom and brightness are held steadfast, a profound stillness 
  pervades. The stage at which the majesty of this stillness becomes constant 
  and solid is called 'the Mind that Resides in Samadhi.'<br>
  &quot;The light of Samadhi emits brightness. When the essence of the brightness 
  enters deeply within, they only advance and never retreat. This is called 'the 
  Mind of Irreversibility.'<br>
  &quot;When the progress of their minds is secure, and they hold their minds 
  and protect them without loss, they connect with the life-breath of The Thus 
  Come Ones of the ten directions. This is called 'the Mind that Protects the 
  Dharma.'<br>
  &quot;Protecting their light of enlightenment, they can use this wonderful force 
  of return to the Buddha's light of compassion and to come back to stand firm 
  with the Buddha. It is like two mirrors that are set facing one another, so 
  that between them the exquisite images inter reflect and enter into one another 
  layer upon layer. This is called 'the Mind of Transference.'<br>
  &quot;With this secret interplay of light, they obtain the Buddha's eternal 
  solidity and unsurpassed wonderful purity, dwelling in the unconditioned, they 
  know no loss or dissipation. This is called 'the Mind that Resides in Precepts.'<br>
  &quot;Abiding in the precepts with self-mastery, they can roam throughout the 
  ten directions, going anywhere they wish. This is called 'the Mind that Resides 
  in Vows.'<br>
  &quot;Ananda, these good people use honest expedients to bring forth those ten 
  minds. When the essence of these minds becomes dazzling, and the ten functions 
  interconnect, then a single mind is perfectly accomplished. This is called 'the 
  Dwelling of Bringing Forth the Resolve.'<br>
  &quot;From within this mind light comes forth like pure crystal, which reveals 
  pure gold inside, treading upon the previous wonderful mind as a ground is called 
  'the Dwelling of the Ground of Regulation.'<br>
  &quot;When the mind-ground connects with wisdom, both become bright and comprehensive. 
  Traversing the ten directions then without obstruction is called 'the Dwelling 
  of Cultivation.'<br>
  &quot;When their conduct is the same as the Buddhas' and they take on the demeanor 
  of a Buddha, then, like the intermediate Skandha body searching for a father 
  and mother, they penetrate the darkness with a hidden trust and enter the lineage 
  of the Thus Come One. This is called 'the Dwelling of Noble Birth.'<br>
  &quot;Since they ride in the womb of the way and will themselves become enlightened 
  heirs, their human features are in no way deficient. This is called 'the Dwelling 
  of Endowment with Skill-in-Means.'<br>
  &quot;With a physical appearance like that of a Buddha and a mind that is the 
  same as well, they are said to be 'Dwelling in the Rectification of the Mind.'<br>
  &quot;United in body and mind, they easily grow and mature day by day. This 
  is called 'the Dwelling of Irreversibility.'<br>
  &quot;With the efficacious appearance of ten bodies, which are simultaneously 
  perfected, they are said to be at 'the Dwelling of a Pure Youth.'<br>
  &quot;Completely developed, they leave the womb and become sons of the Buddha. 
  This is called 'the Dwelling of a Dharma Prince.'<br>
  &quot;Reaching the fullness of adulthood, they are like the chosen prince to 
  whom the great king of a country turns over the affairs of state. When this 
  Kshatriya king's eldest son is ceremoniously anointed on the crown of the head, 
  he has reached what is called 'the Dwelling of Anointing the Crown of the Head.'<br>
  &quot;Ananda, after these good men have become sons of the Buddha, they are 
  replete with the limitlessly many wonderful virtues of the Thus Come Ones, and 
  they comply and accord with beings throughout the ten directions. This is called 
  'the Conduct of Happiness.'<br>
  &quot;Being will able to accommodate all living beings is called 'the Conduct 
  of Benefitting.'<br>
  &quot;Enlightened oneself and enlightened others without putting forth any resistance 
  is called 'the Conduct of Non-Opposition.'<br>
  &quot;To undergo birth in various forms continuously to the bounds of the future, 
  equally throughout the three periods of time and pervading the ten directions, 
  is called 'the Conduct of Endlessness.'<br>
  &quot;When everything is equally in accord, one never makes mistakes among the 
  various Dharma doors. This is called 'the Conduct of Freedom from Deluded Confusion.'<br>
  &quot;Then within what is identical, myriad differences appear; the characteristics 
  of every difference are seen, one and all, in identity. This is called 'the 
  Conduct of Wholesome Manifestation.'<br>
  &quot;This continues until it includes all the dust motes that fill up empty 
  space throughout the ten directions. In each and every mote of dust there appear 
  the worlds of the ten directions. And yet the appearance of dust motes and the 
  appearances of worlds do not interfere with one another. This is called 'the 
  Conduct of Non-Attachment.'<br>
  &quot;Everything that appears before one is the foremost Paramita. This is called 
  'the Conduct of Veneration.'<br>
  &quot;With such perfect fusion, one can model oneself after all the Buddhas 
  of the ten directions. This is called 'the Conduct of Wholesome Dharma.'<br>
  &quot;To then be pure and without outflows in each and every way is the primary 
  truth, which is unconditioned, the essence of the nature. This is called 'the 
  Conduct of True Actuality.'<br>
  &quot;Ananda, when these good men replete with spiritual penetrations, have 
  done the Buddhas' work, are totally pure and absolutely true, and remain distant 
  from obstacles and calamities, then they take living beings across while casting 
  aside the appearance of taking them across. They transform the unconditioned 
  mind and go toward the path Nirvana. This is called 'the Transference of Saving 
  and Protecting Living Beings, While Apart from the Appearance of Living Being.'<br>
  &quot;To destroy what should be destroyed and to remain far removed from what 
  should be left behind is called 'the Transference of Indestructibility.'<br>
  &quot;Fundamental enlightenment is profound indeed, an enlightenment equal to 
  the Buddhas' enlightenment. This is called 'the Transference of Sameness with 
  All Buddhas.'<br>
  &quot;When absolute truth is discovered, one's level is the same as the level 
  of all Buddhas. This is called 'the Transference of Reaching All Places.'<br>
  &quot;Worlds and Thus Come Ones include one another without any obstruction. 
  This is called 'the Transference of a Treasury of Inexhaustible Merit and Virtue.'<br>
  &quot;Since they are identical with the Buddha-ground, they create causes which 
  are pure at each and every level. Brilliance emanates from them as they rely 
  on these causes, and they go straight down the path to Nirvana. This is called 
  'the Transference of Following in Accord with the Identity of All Good Roots.'&quot;<br>
  &quot;When the true roots are set down, then all living beings in the ten directions 
  are my own nature. Not a single being is lost, as this nature is successfully 
  perfected. This is called 'the Transference of Contemplating all Living Beings 
  Equally.'<br>
  &quot;All Dharmas are themselves apart from all appearances, and yet there is 
  no attachment either to their existence or to separation from them. This is 
  called 'the Transference of the Appearance of True Suchness.'<br>
  &quot;That which is thus is truly obtained, and there is no obstruction throughout 
  the ten directions. This is called 'the Transference of Unfettered Liberation.'<br>
  &quot;When the virtue of the nature is perfectly accomplished, the boundaries 
  of the Dharma realm are destroyed. This is called 'the Transference of the Limitlessness 
  of the Dharma Realm'<br>
  &quot;Ananda, when these good men have completely purified these forty-one minds, 
  they further accomplish four kinds of wonderfully perfect additional practices.<br>
  &quot;When the enlightenment of a Buddha is just about to become a function 
  of his own mind, it is on the verge of emerging but has not yet emerged, and 
  so it can be compared to the point just before wood ignites when it is drilled 
  to produce fire. Therefore it is called 'the Level of Heat.'<br>
  &quot;He continues on with his mind, treading where the Buddhas tread, as if 
  relying and yet not. It is as if he were climbing a lofty mountain, to the point 
  where his body is in space but there remains a slight obstruction beneath him. 
  Therefore it is called 'the Level of the Summit.'<br>
  &quot;When the mind and the Buddha are two and yet the same, he has well obtained 
  the Middle Way. He is like someone who endures something when it seems impossible 
  to either hold it in or let it out. Therefore it is called 'the Level of Patience.'<br>
  &quot;When numbers are destroyed, there are no such designations as the Middle 
  Way or as confusion and enlightenment. This is called the 'Level of Being First 
  in the World.'<br>
  &quot;Ananda, these good men have successfully penetrated through to great Bodhi. 
  Their enlightenment is entirely like the Thus Come One's. They have fathomed 
  the state of Buddhahood. This is called 'the Ground of Happiness.'<br>
  &quot;The differences enter into identity; the identity is destroyed. This is 
  called 'the Ground of Leaving Filth.'<br>
  &quot;At the point of ultimate purity, brightness comes forth. This is called 
  'the Ground of Emitting Light.'<br>
  &quot;When the brightness becomes ultimate, enlightenment is full. This is called 
  'the Ground of Blazing Wisdom.'<br>
  &quot;No identity or difference can be attained. This is called 'the Ground 
  of Invincibility.'<br>
  &quot;With unconditioned True Suchness, the nature is spotless, and brightness 
  is revealed. This is called 'the Ground of Manifestation.'<br>
  &quot;Coming to the farthest limits of True Suchness is called 'the Ground of 
  Traveling Far'.<br>
  &quot;The single mind of True Suchness is called 'the Ground of Immovability.'<br>
  &quot;Bringing both the function of True Suchness is called 'the Ground of Good 
  Wisdom.'<br>
  &quot;Ananda, all Bodhisattvas at this point and beyond have reached the effortless 
  way in their cultivation. Their merit and virtue are perfected, and so all the 
  previous positions are also called 'the Level of Cultivation.'<br>
  &quot;Then with a wonderful cloud of compassionate protection one covers the 
  sea of Nirvana. This is called 'the Ground of the Dharma Cloud.'<br>
  &quot;The Thus Come Ones counter the flow as the Bodhisattvas thus reach this 
  point through compliance with practice. Their enlightenments intermingle; it 
  is therefore called 'Equal Enlightenment.'<br>
  &quot;Ananda, the enlightenment which encompasses the mind of dry wisdom through 
  to the culmination of equal enlightenment is the initial attainment of the Vajra 
  mind. This constitutes the level of 'Initial Dry Wisdom.'<br>
  &quot;Thus there are totals of twelve single and grouped levels. At last they 
  reach Wonderful Enlightenment and accomplish the Unsurpassed Way.<br>
  &quot;At all these levels they use Vajra contemplation of the Ten Profound Analogies 
  for the ways in which things are like an illusion. In Shamatha they use the 
  Thus Come Ones' Vipashyana to cultivate them purely, to be certified to them, 
  and to gradually enter them more and more deeply.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, because they put to use the three means of advancement throughout 
  all of them, they are will able to accomplish the fifty-five stages of the true 
  Bodhi path.<br>
  &quot;This manner of contemplation is called 'proper contemplation.' Contemplation 
  other than this is called 'deviant contemplation.'&quot;<br>
  Then Dharma Prince Manjushri arose from his seat, and in the midst of the assembly 
  he bowed at the Buddha's feet and said to the Buddha, &quot;What is the name 
  of this sutra and how should we and all living beings uphold it?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Manjushri, &quot;this sutra is called 'the summit, syi dan dwo 
  bwo da la, and unsurpassed precious seal of the seal of the great Buddha, and 
  the pure, clear, ocean-like eye of The Thus Comes Ones of the ten directions.'<br>
  &quot;It is also called 'the Cause for Saving a Relative': to rescue Ananda 
  and the Bhikshuni 'Nature,' who is now in this assembly, so that they obtain 
  the Bodhi mind and enter the sea of pervasive knowledge.<br>
  &quot;It is also called 'the Tathagata's Secret Cause of Cultivation, his certification 
  to the complete meaning.' <br>
  &quot;It is also called 'the Great Pervasive Method, the Wonderful Lotus Flower 
  King, the Dharani Mantra which is the Mother of all Buddhas of the Ten Directions.'<br>
  &quot;It is also called 'the Foremost Shurangama, Sections and Phrases for Anointing 
  the Crown of the Head, and all Bodhisattvas' Myriad Practices.'<br>
  &quot;Thus should you respectfully uphold it.&quot;<br>
  After this was said, Ananda and all in the great assembly immediately received 
  The Thus Come one's instruction in the secret seal, the meaning of bwo da la, 
  and heard these names for the complete meaning of this sutra.<br>
  They were suddenly enlightened to Dhyana, advanced in their cultivation to the 
  sagely position, and increased their understanding of the wonderful principle. 
  Their minds were focused and serene.<br>
  Ananda cut off and cast aside Six Sections of Subtle Afflictions in his cultivation 
  of the mind in the Triple Realm.<br>
  He arose from his seat, bowed at the Buddha's feet, placed his palms together 
  respectfully, and said to the Buddha, 'The great, awesome and virtuous World 
  Honored One, whose compassionate sound knows no limit, has well instructed living 
  beings as to their extremely subtle submersion in delusion and has caused me 
  on this day to become blissful in body and mind and to obtain enormous benefit.<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, if the wonderful brightness, of this truly pure and 
  wonderful mind is basically all-pervading, then everything on the great earth, 
  including the grasses and trees, the wriggling worms and tiny forms of life 
  are originally True Suchness and are themselves The Thus Come One-the Buddha's 
  true body.<br>
  &quot;Since the Buddha's body is true and real, how can there also be hells, 
  hungry ghosts, animals, Asuras, humans, gods, and other paths of rebirth? World 
  Honored One, do these paths exist naturally of themselves, or are they created 
  by living beings' falseness and habits?<br>
  &quot;World Honored One, the Bhikshuni Precious Lotus Fragrance, for example, 
  received the Bodhisattva precepts and then indulged in lustful desire, saying 
  that sexual acts did not involve killing or stealing and that they carried no 
  Karmic retribution. But after saying this, her female organs caught fire, and 
  then the raging blaze spread throughout all her joints as she fell into the 
  unintermittent hell alive.<br>
  &quot;And there were the Mighty King Crystal and the Bhikshu Good Stars. Crystal 
  exterminated the Gautama clan and good stars lied and said that all Dharmas 
  are empty. They both sank into the unintermittent hell alive.<br>
  &quot;Are these hells fixed places, or do they arise spontaneously? Is it that 
  each individual undergoes whatever kind of Karma he or she creates? I only hope 
  the Buddha will be compassionate and instruct those of us who do not understand 
  this. May he cause all beings who uphold the precepts to positively and respectfully 
  receive this determination upon hearing, it can be careful and clear, free from 
  any violations.&quot;<br>
  The Buddha said to Ananda, &quot;What a good question! You want to keep all 
  living beings from entering into deviant views. You should listen attentively 
  now and I will explain this matter for you.<br>
  &quot;Actually, Ananda, all living beings are fundamentally true and pure, but 
  because of their false views they give rise to the falseness of habits, which 
  are divided into an internal aspect and an external aspect.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, the internal aspect refers to what occurs inside living beings. 
  Because of love and defilement, they produce the falseness of emotions. When 
  these emotions accumulate without cease, they can create the fluids of love.<br>
  &quot;That is why living beings' mouths water when they think about delicious 
  food. When they think about a deceased person, either with fondness or with 
  anger, tears will flow from their eyes. When they are greedy for wealth and 
  jewels, a current of lust will course through their hearts. When confronted 
  with a smooth and supple body, their minds become attached to lustful conduct 
  and from both male and female organs will come spontaneous secretions.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, although the kinds of love differ, their flow and oppression is 
  the same. With this moisture, one cannot ascend, but will naturally fall. This 
  is called the 'internal aspect.'<br>
  &quot;Ananda, the 'external aspect' refers to what happens outside living beings. 
  Because of longing and yearning, they invent the fallacy of discursive thought. 
  When this reasoning accumulates without cease, it can create ascending vapors.<br>
  &quot;That is why when living beings uphold the prohibitive precepts in their 
  minds, their bodies will be buoyant and feel light and clear. When they uphold 
  mantra seals in their minds, they will command a heroic and resolute perspective. 
  When they have the desire in their minds to be born in the heavens, in their 
  dreams they will have thoughts of flying and ascending. When they cherish the 
  Buddhalands in their minds, then the sagely realms will appear in a shimmering 
  vision, and they will serve the good and wise advisors with little thought for 
  their own lives.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, although the thought varies, the lightness and uplifting is the 
  same. With flight and ascension, one will not sink, but will naturally become 
  transcendent. This is called the external aspect.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, all beings in the world are caught up in the continuity of birth 
  and death. Birth happens because of their habitual tendencies; death comes through 
  flow and change. When they are on the verge of dying, but when the final warmth 
  has not left their bodies, all the good and evil they have done in that life 
  suddenly and simultaneously manifests. They experience the intermingling of 
  two habits: an abhorrence of death and an attraction to life.<br>
  &quot;Endowed solely with thought, they will fly and can certainly be reborn 
  in the heavens above. If they fly from the heart, and if they have blessing 
  and wisdom, as well as pure vows, then their hearts will spontaneously open 
  and they will see the Buddhas of the ten directions and all their pure lands 
  and they will be reborn in whichever one they wish.<br>
  &quot;When they have more thought than emotion, they are not quite as ethereal 
  and so they become flying immortals, great mighty ghost kings, space- traveling 
  Yakshas, or earth-traveling Rakshasas who roam the form heavens, going where 
  they please without obstruction.<br>
  &quot;Among them may be some with good vows and good hearts who protect and 
  uphold my Dharma. Perhaps they protect the pure precepts by following and supporting 
  those who hold precepts. Perhaps they protect spiritual mantras by following 
  and supporting those who hold mantras. Perhaps they protect Ch'an Samadhi by 
  guarding and comforting those who are patient with Dharmas. These beings are 
  close at hand beneath The Thus Come One's seat.<br>
  &quot;When their thought and emotion are of equal proportions, they cannot fly 
  and they do not fall, but are born in the human realm. If their thought is bright, 
  their wits are keen. If their emotion is dark, their wits are dull.<br>
  &quot;When they have more emotion than thought, they enter the animal realm. 
  With heavier emotion, they become fur-bearing beasts; with lighter emotion, 
  they become winged creatures.<br>
  &quot;When they have seventy percent emotion and thirty percent thought, they 
  fall beneath the wheel of water into the regions of fire, where they come into 
  contact with steam which is itself like a terrible blaze. In the bodies of hungry 
  ghosts, they are constantly burned by that fire. Even water harms them, and 
  they have nothing to eat or drink for hundreds of thousands of Kalpas.<br>
  &quot;When they have ninety percent emotion and ten percent thought, they fall 
  through the wheel of fire until their bodies enter wind and fire, in a region 
  where the two interact. With lighter emotion they are born in the intermittent 
  hell; with heavier emotion they are born in the unintermittent hell.<br>
  &quot;When they are possessed entirely of emotion, they sink into the Avici 
  Hell. If the emotion has gone into their hearts so that they slander the Great 
  Vehicle, defame the Buddha's pure precepts, speak crazy and false Dharma, are 
  greedy for offerings form the faithful, recklessly accept the respect of others, 
  commit the five rebellious acts and the ten major offenses, then they are further 
  reborn in Avici Hells throughout the ten directions.<br>
  &quot;Although one receives one's due according to the evil Karma one has created, 
  a group can undergo an identical lot, and there are definite places where it 
  occurs.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, it all comes from the Karmic responses which living beings themselves 
  invoke. They create ten habitual causes and undergo six interacting retributions.<br>
  &quot;What are the ten causes? Ananda, the first consists of habits of lust 
  and reciprocal interactions, which give rise to mutual rubbing. When this rubbing 
  continues without cease, it produces a tremendous raging fire within which movement 
  occurs, just as warmth arises between a person's hands when he rubs them together.<br>
  &quot;Because these two habits set each other ablaze, there come into being 
  the iron bed, the copper pillar, and other such experiences.<br>
  &quot;Therefore The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions look upon the practice 
  of lust and name it the 'fire of desire.' Bodhisattvas avoid desire as they 
  would a fiery pit.<br>
  &quot;The second consists of habits of greed and intermingled scheming which 
  give rise to a suction. When this suction becomes dominant and incessant, it 
  produces intense cold and solid ice where freezing occurs, just as a sensation 
  of cold is experienced when a person draws in a blast of wind through his mouth.<br>
  &quot;Because these two habits clash together, there come into being chattering, 
  whimpering and shuddering; blue, red, and white lotuses; cold and ice; and other 
  such experiences.<br>
  &quot;The third consists of habits of arrogance and resulting friction which 
  give rise to mutual intimidation. When it accelerates without cease, it produces 
  torrents and rapids, which create restless waves of water, just as water is 
  produced when a person continuously works his tongue in an effort to taste flavors.<br>
  &quot;Because these two habits incite one another, there come into being the 
  river of blood, the river of ashes, the burning sand, the poisonous sea, the 
  molten copper which is poured over one or which must be swallowed, and other 
  such experiences.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions look upon self-satisfaction 
  and name it 'drinking the water of stupidity.' Bodhisattvas avoid arrogance 
  as they would a huge deluge.<br>
  &quot;The fourth consists of habits of hatred which give rise to mutual defiance. 
  When this defiance binds one without cease, one's heart becomes so hot that 
  it catches fire, and the molten vapor turns into metal.<br>
  &quot;From it is produced the mountain of knives, the iron cudgel, the tree 
  of swords, the wheel of swords, axes and halberds, and spears and saws. It is 
  like the intent to kill surging forth when a person meets a mortal enemy, so 
  that he is roused to action.<br>
  &quot;Because these two habits clash with one another, there come into being 
  castration and hacking, beheading and mutilation, filing and sticking, flogging 
  and beating, and other such experiences.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions look upon hatred and 
  name it 'sharp knives and swords.' Bodhisattvas avoid hatred as they would their 
  own execution.<br>
  'The fifth consists of habits of deception and misleading involvements which 
  give rise to mutual guile. When such maneuvering continues without cease, it 
  produces the ropes and wood of a gallows for hanging, like the grass and trees 
  that grow when water saturates a field.<br>
  &quot;Because the two habits perpetuate one another, there come into being handcuffs 
  and fetters, cangues and locks, whips and clubs, sticks and cudgels, and other 
  such experiences.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions look upon deception 
  and name it a 'treacherous crook.' Bodhisattvas fear deception as they would 
  a savage wolf.<br>
  &quot;The sixth consists of habits of lying and combined fraudulence which give 
  rise to mutual cheating. When false accusations continue without cease, one 
  becomes adept at corruption.<br>
  &quot;From this there come into being dust and dirt, excrement and urine, filth, 
  stench, and impurities. It is like the obscuring of everyone's vision when the 
  dust is stirred up by the wind.<br>
  &quot;Because these two habits augment one another, there come into being sinking 
  and drowning, tossing and pitching, flying and falling, floating and submerging, 
  and other such experiences.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions look upon lying and 
  name it 'robbery and murder.' Bodhisattvas regard lying as they would treading 
  on a venomous snake.<br>
  &quot;The seventh consists of habits of animosity and interconnected enmity 
  which give rise to grievances. From this there come into being flying rocks, 
  thrown stones, caskets and closets, cages on wheels, jars and containers, and 
  bags and rods. It is like someone harming others secretly-he harbors, cherishes, 
  and nurtures evil.<br>
  &quot;Because these two habits swallow one another up, there come into being 
  tossing and pitching, seizing and apprehending, striking and shooting, casting 
  away and pinching, and other such experiences.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions look upon animosity 
  and name it a 'disobedient and harmful ghost.' Bodhisattvas regard animosity 
  as they would, drinking poisonous wine.<br>
  &quot;The eighth consists of habits of views and the admixture of understanding, 
  such as Satkayadrishti, views, moral prohibitions, grasping, and deviant insight 
  into various kinds of Karma, which bring about opposition and produce mutual 
  antagonism. From them there come into being court officials, deputies, certifiers, 
  and registrars. They are like people traveling on a road, who meet each other 
  coming and going.<br>
  &quot;Because these two habits influence one another, there come into being 
  official inquiries, baited questions, examinations, interrogations, public investigations, 
  exposure, the youths who record good and evil, carrying the record books of 
  the offenders' arguments and rationalizations, and other such experiences.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions look upon evil views 
  and name them the 'pit of views.' Bodhisattvas regard having false and one-sided 
  views as they would, standing on the edge of a steep ravine full of poison.<br>
  &quot;The ninth consists of the habits of injustice and their interconnected 
  support of one another; they result in instigating false charges and libeling. 
  From them are produced crushing between mountains, crushing between rocks, stone 
  rollers, stone grinders, plowing, and pulverizing. It is like a slanderous villain 
  who engages in persecuting good people unjustly. <br>
  &quot;Because these two habits join ranks, there come into being pressing and 
  pushing, bludgeons and compulsion, squeezing and straining, weighing and measuring, 
  and other such experiences. <br>
  &quot;Therefore, The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions look upon harmful 
  accusations and name them 'a treacherous tiger.' Bodhisattvas regard injustice 
  as they would, a bolt of lightning.<br>
  &quot;The tenth consists of the habits of litigation and the mutual disputations 
  which give rise to covering. From them there are produced a look in the mirror 
  and illumination by the lamp. It is like being in direct sunlight: there is 
  no way one can hide one's shadow.<br>
  &quot;Because these two habits bicker back and forth, there come into being 
  evil companions, the mirror of Karma, the fiery pearl, exposure of past Karma, 
  inquests, and other such experiences.<br>
  &quot;Therefore, all The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions look upon covering 
  and name it a 'yin villain.' Bodhisattvas regard covering as they would, having 
  to carry a mountain atop their heads while walking upon the sea.<br>
  &quot;What are the six retributions? Ananda, living beings create Karma with 
  their six consciousnesses. The evil retributions they call down upon themselves 
  come from the six sense organs.<br>
  &quot;What are the evil retributions that arise from the six sense organs? The 
  first is the retribution of seeing, which beckons one and leads one to evil 
  ends. The Karma of seeing intermingles, so that at the time of death one first 
  sees a raging conflagration, which fills the ten directions. The deceased one's 
  spiritual consciousness takes flight, but then falls. Riding on a wisp of smoke, 
  it enters the unintermittent hell.<br>
  &quot;There, it is aware of two appearances. One is a perception of brightness 
  in which can be seen all sorts of evil things, and it gives rise to boundless 
  fear. The other is a perception of darkness in which there is total stillness 
  and no sight, and it experiences boundless terror.<br>
  &quot;When the fire that comes from seeing burns the sense of hearing, it becomes 
  cauldrons of boiling water and molten copper. When it burns the breath, it becomes 
  black smoke and purple fumes. When it burns the sense of taste, it becomes scorching 
  not pellets and molten iron gruel. When it burns the sense of touch, it becomes 
  white-hot embers and glowing coals. When it burns the mind, it becomes stars 
  of fire that shower everywhere and whip up and inflame the entire realm of space.<br>
  &quot;The second is the retribution of hearing, which beckons one and leads 
  one to evil ends. The Karma of hearing intermingles, and thus at the time of 
  death one first sees gigantic waves that drown heaven and earth. The deceased 
  one's spiritual consciousness falls into the water and rides the current into 
  the unintermittent hell.<br>
  &quot;There, it is aware of two sensations. One is open hearing, in which it 
  hears all sorts of noise and its essential spirit becomes confused. The other 
  is closed hearing, in which there is total stillness and no hearing, and its 
  soul sinks into oblivion.<br>
  &quot;When the waves from hearing flow into the hearing, they become scolding 
  and interrogation. When they flow into the seeing, they become thunder and roaring 
  and evil poisonous vapors. When they flow into the breath, they become rain 
  and fog that is permeated with poisonous organisms that entirely fill up the 
  body. When they flow into the sense of taste, they become pus and blood and 
  every kind of filth. When they flow into the sense of touch, they become animals 
  and ghosts, and excrement and urine. When they flow into the mind, they become 
  lighting and hail, which ravage the heart and soul.<br>
  &quot;The third is the retribution of smelling, which beckons one and leads 
  one to evil ends. The Karma of smelling intermingles, and thus at the time of 
  death one first sees a poisonous smoke that permeates the atmosphere near and 
  far. The deceased one's spiritual consciousness wells up out of the earth and 
  enters the unintermittent hell.<br>
  &quot;There, it is aware of two sensations. One is unobstructed smelling, in 
  which it is thoroughly infused with the evil vapors and its mind becomes distressed. 
  The other is obstructed smelling, in which its breath is cut off and there is 
  no passage, and it lies stifled and suffocating on the ground.<br>
  &quot;When the vapor of smelling invades the breath, it becomes cross-examination 
  and bearing witness. When it invades the seeing, it becomes fire and torches. 
  When it invades the hearing, it becomes sinking and drowning, oceans, and bubbling 
  cauldrons. When it invades the sense of taste, it becomes putrid or rancid foods. 
  When it invades the sense of touch, it becomes ripping apart and beating to 
  a pulp. It also becomes a huge mountain of flesh which has a hundred thousand 
  eyes and which is sucked and fed upon by numberless worms. When it invades the 
  mind, it becomes ashes, pestilent airs, and flying sand and gravel, which cut 
  the body to ribbons.<br>
  &quot;The fourth is the retribution of tasting, which beckons one and leads 
  one to evil ends. This Karma of tasting intermingles, and thus at the time of 
  death one first sees an iron net ablaze with a raging fire that covers over 
  the entire world. The deceased one's spiritual consciousness passes down through 
  this hanging net, and suspended upside down it enters the unintermittent hell.<br>
  &quot;There, it is aware of two sensations. One is a sucking air, which congeals 
  into ice so that it freezes the flesh of his body. The other is a spitting blast 
  of air, which spews out a raging fire that roasts his bones and marrow to a 
  pulp.<br>
  &quot;When the tasting of flavors passes through the sense of taste, it becomes 
  what must be acknowledged and what must be endured. When it passes through the 
  seeing, it becomes burning metal and stones. When it passes through the hearing, 
  it becomes sharp weapons and knives. When it passes through the sense of smell, 
  it becomes a vast iron cage that encloses the entire land. When it passes through 
  the sense of touch, it becomes bows and arrows, crossbows, and darts. When it 
  passes through the mind, it becomes flying pieces of molten iron that rain down 
  from out of space. <br>
  &quot;The fifth is the retribution of touching, which beckons one and leads 
  one to evil ends. The Karma of touching intermingles, and thus at the time of 
  death one first sees huge mountains closing in on one from four sides, leaving 
  no path of escape. The deceased one's spiritual consciousness then sees a vast 
  iron city. Fiery snakes and fiery dogs, wolves, lions, ox-headed jail keepers, 
  and horse-headed Rakshasas brandishing spears and lances drive it into the iron 
  city toward the unintermittent hell.<br>
  &quot;There, it is aware of two sensations. One is touch that involves coming 
  together, in which mountains come together to squeeze its body until its flesh, 
  bones, and blood are totally dispersed. The other is touch that involves separation, 
  in which knives and swords attack the body, ripping the heart and liver to shreds.<br>
  &quot;When this touching passes through the sensation of touch, it becomes striking, 
  binding, stabbing, and piercing. When it passes through the seeing, it becomes 
  burning and scorching. When it passes through the hearing, it becomes questioning, 
  investigating, court examinations, and interrogation. When it passes through 
  the sense of smell, it becomes enclosures, bags, beating, and binding up. When 
  it passes through the sense of taste, it becomes plowing, pinching, chopping, 
  and severing. When it passes through the mind, it becomes falling, flying, frying, 
  and broiling.<br>
  &quot;The sixth is the retribution of thinking, which beckons one and leads 
  one to evil ends. The Karma of thinking intermingles, and thus at the time of 
  death one first sees a foul wind which devastates the land. The deceased one's 
  spiritual consciousness is blown up into space, and then, spiraling downward, 
  it rides that wind straight into the unintermittent hell.<br>
  &quot;There, it is aware of two sensations. One is extreme confusion, which 
  causes it to be frantic and to race about ceaselessly. The other is not confusion, 
  but rather an acute awareness, which causes it to suffer from endless roasting 
  and burning, the extreme pain of which is difficult to bear.<br>
  &quot;When this deviant thought combines with thinking, it becomes locations 
  and places. When it combines with seeing, it becomes inspection and testimonies. 
  When it combines with hearing, it becomes huge crushing rocks, ice and frost, 
  dirt and fog. When it combines with smelling, it becomes a great fiery car, 
  a fiery boat, and a fiery jail. When it combines with tasting, it becomes loud 
  calling, wailing, and regretful crying. When it combines with touch, it becomes 
  sensations of large and small, where ten thousand births and ten thousands deaths 
  are endured every day, and of lying with one's face to the ground.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, these are called the ten causes and six retributions of the hells, 
  which are all created by the confusion and falseness of living beings.<br>
  &quot;If living beings create this evil Karma simultaneously, they enter the 
  Avici Hell and endure limitless suffering, passing through limitless Kalpas.<br>
  &quot;If the three Karmas of body, mouth, and mind commit acts of killing, stealing, 
  and lust, the person will enter the eighteen hells.<br>
  &quot;If the three Karmas are not all involved, and there is perhaps just one 
  act of killing and/or of stealing, then the person must enter the thirty-six 
  hells.<br>
  &quot;If the sense organ of sight alone commits just one Karmic offense, then 
  the person must enter the one hundred and eight hells.<br>
  &quot;Because of this, living beings who do certain things create certain Karma, 
  and so in the world they enter collective hells, which arise from false thinking 
  and which originally are not there at all.<br>
  &quot;And then, Ananda, after the living beings who have slandered and destroyed 
  rules and deportment, violated the Bodhisattva precepts, slandered the Buddha's 
  Nirvana, and created various other kinds of Karma, pass through many Kalpas 
  of being burned in the inferno, they finally finish paying for their offenses 
  and are reborn as ghosts.<br>
  &quot;If greed for material objects was the original cause that made the person 
  commit offenses, then, after he was finished paying for his crimes, he takes 
  shape when he encounters material objects, and he is called a strange ghost.<br>
  &quot;If it was greed for lust that made the person commit offenses, then, after 
  he has finished paying for his crimes, he takes shape when he encounters the 
  wind, and he is called a drought-ghost.<br>
  &quot;If it was greed to lie that made the person commit offenses, then, after 
  he has finished paying for his crimes, he takes shape when he encounters an 
  animal, and he is called a Mei ghost.<br>
  &quot;If it was greed for hatred that made the person commit offenses, then, 
  after he has finished paying for his crimes, he takes shape when he encounters 
  worms, and he is called a Ku poison ghost.<br>
  &quot;If it was greed for animosity that made the person commit, then, after 
  he has finished paying for his crimes, he takes shape when he encounters degeneration, 
  and he is called a pestilence ghost.<br>
  &quot;If it was greed to be arrogant that made the person commit offenses, then 
  after he has finished paying for his crimes, he takes shape when he encounters 
  gases, and he is called a hungry ghost.<br>
  &quot;If it was greed to be unjust to others that made the person commit offenses, 
  then after he has finished paying for his crimes, he takes shape when he encounters 
  darkness, and he is called a paralysis ghost.<br>
  &quot;If it was greed for views that made the person commit offenses, then, 
  after he has finished paying for his crimes, he takes shape when he encounters 
  essential energy, and he is called a Wang-liang ghost.<br>
  &quot;If it was greed for deception that made the person commit offenses, then, 
  after he has finished paying for his crimes, he takes shape when he encounters 
  brightness, and he is called a servant ghost.<br>
  &quot;If it was greed to be litigious that made the person commit offenses, 
  then, after he has finished paying for his crimes, he takes shape when he encounters 
  people, and he is called a messenger ghost.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, such a person's fall is due to his totally emotional level of 
  functioning. When his Karmic fire has burned out, he will rise up to be reborn 
  as a ghost. This is occasioned by his own Karma of false thinking. If he awakens 
  to Bodhi, then in the wonderful perfect brightness, there isn't anything at 
  all.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, when his Karma as a ghost is ended, the problem of emotion 
  as opposed to discursive thought is resolved. At that point he must pay back 
  in kind what he borrowed from others to resolve those grievances. He is born 
  into the body of an animal to repay his debts from past lives.<br>
  'The retribution of the strange ghost of material objects is finished when the 
  object is destroyed and it is reborn in the world, usually as a species of owl.<br>
  &quot;The retribution of the drought ghost of the wind is finished when the 
  wind subsides, and it is reborn in the world, usually as a species of weird 
  creature which gives inauspicious prognostications.<br>
  &quot;The retribution of the Mei ghost of an animal is finished when the animal 
  dies, and it is reborn in the world, usually as a species of fox.<br>
  &quot;The retribution of the Ku ghost in the form of worms is finished when 
  the Ku is exhausted, and it is reborn in the world, usually as a species of 
  venomous creature.<br>
  &quot;The retribution of a pestilence ghost found in degeneration is finished 
  when the degeneration is complete, and it is reborn in the world, usually as 
  a species of tapeworm.<br>
  &quot;The retribution of the ghost which takes shape in gases is finished when 
  the gases are gone, and it is then reborn in the world, usually as a species 
  of eating animal.<br>
  &quot;The retribution of the ghost of prolonged darkness is finished when the 
  darkness ends, and it is then reborn in the world, usually as a species of animal 
  used for clothing or service.<br>
  &quot;The retribution of the ghost which unites with energy is finished when 
  the union dissolves, and it is then reborn in the world, usually as a species 
  of migratory creature.<br>
  &quot;The retribution of the ghost of brightness and intellect is finished when 
  the brightness disappears, and it is then reborn in the world, usually as a 
  species of auspicious creature.<br>
  &quot;The retribution of the ghost that relies on a person is finished when 
  the person dies, and it is then reborn in the world, usually as a species of 
  domestic animal.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, all this is due to the burning out of his Karmic fire in payment 
  for his debts from past lives. The rebirth as an animal is also occasioned by 
  his own false and empty Karma. If he awakens to Bodhi, then fundamentally none 
  of these false conditions will exist at all.<br>
  &quot;You mentioned precious Lotus Fragrance, King Crystal, and Bhikshu Good 
  Stars. Evil Karma, such as theirs, was created by them alone. It did not fall 
  down out of the heavens or well up from the earth, nor was it imposed upon them 
  by some person. Their own falseness brought it into being, and so they themselves 
  have to undergo it. In the Bodhi mind, it is empty and false-a cohesion of false 
  thoughts.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, if while repaying his past debts by undergoing rebirth 
  as an animal, such a living being pays back more than he owed, he will then 
  be reborn as a human to rectify the excess.<br>
  &quot;If he is a person with strength, blessings, and virtue, then once he is 
  in the human realm, he will not have to lose his human rebirth after what is 
  owed him is restored. But if he lacks blessings, then he will return to the 
  animal realm to continue repaying his debts.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, you should know that once the debt is paid, whether with money, 
  material goods, or manual labor, the process of repayment naturally comes to 
  an end.<br>
  &quot;But if in the process he took the lives of other beings or ate their flesh, 
  then he continues in the same way, passing through Kalpas as many as motes of 
  fine dust, taking turns devouring and being slaughtered in a cycle that sends 
  him up and down endlessly.<br>
  &quot;There is no way to put a stop to it, except through Shamatha or through 
  a Buddha's coming to the world.<br>
  &quot;You should know that when owls and their kind have paid back their debts, 
  they regain their original form and are born as people, but among those who 
  are corrupt and obstinate.<br>
  &quot;When creatures that are inauspicious have paid back their debts, they 
  regain their original form and are born as people, but among those who are abnormal.<br>
  &quot;When foxes have paid back their debts, they regain their original forms 
  and are born as people, but among those who are simpletons.<br>
  &quot;When creatures of the venomous category have paid back their debts, they 
  regain their original form and are born as people, but among those who are hateful.<br>
  &quot;When tapeworms and their like have paid back their debts, they regain 
  their original form and are born as people, but among those who are lowly.<br>
  &quot;When the edible types of creatures have paid back their debts, they regain 
  their original form and are reborn as people, but among those who are weak.<br>
  &quot;When creatures that are used for clothing or service have paid back their 
  debts, they regain their original form and are reborn as people, but among those 
  who do hard labor.<br>
  &quot;When creatures that migrate have paid back their debts, they regain their 
  original form and are reborn as people among those who are literate. <br>
  &quot;When auspicious creatures have paid back their debts, they regain their 
  original form and are reborn as people among those who are intelligent. <br>
  &quot;When domestic animals have paid back their debts, they regain their original 
  form and are reborn as people among those who are well-informed.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, these are all beings that have finished paying back former debts 
  and are born again in the human realm. They are involved in a beginningless 
  scheme of Karma and being upside down in which their lives are spent killing 
  one another and being killed by one another. They do not get to meet The Thus 
  Come One or hear the proper Dharma they just abide in the wearisome dust, passing 
  through a repetitive cycle. Such people can truly be called pitiful.<br>
  &quot;Furthermore, Ananda, there are people who do not rely on proper enlightenment 
  to cultivate Samadhi, but cultivate in some special way that is based on their 
  false thinking. Holding to the idea of perpetuating their physical bodies, they 
  roam in the mountains and forests in places people do not go and become ten 
  kinds of immortals.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, some living beings with unflagging resolution make themselves 
  strong with doses of medicine. When they have perfected this method of ingestion, 
  they are known as earth-traveling immortals.<br>
  &quot;Some of these beings with unflagging resolution make themselves strong 
  through the use of grasses and herbs. When they have perfected this method of 
  taking herbs, they are known as flying immortals.<br>
  &quot;Some of these beings with unflagging resolution make themselves strong 
  through the use of metal and stone. When they have perfected this method of 
  transformation, they are known as roaming immortals.<br>
  &quot;Some of these beings with unflagging resolution make themselves strong 
  through movement cessation. When they have perfected their breath and essence, 
  they are known as space-traveling immortals.<br>
  &quot;Some beings with unflagging resolution make themselves strong by using 
  the flow of saliva. When they have perfected the virtues of this moisture, they 
  are known as heaven-traveling immortals.<br>
  &quot;Some beings with unflagging resolution make themselves strong with the 
  essence of sun and moon when they have perfected the inhalation of this purity, 
  they are known as immortals of penetrating conduct.<br>
  &quot;Some beings with unflagging resolution make themselves strong through 
  mantras and prohibitions. When they have perfected these spells and Dharmas, 
  they are known as immortals with way-conduct.<br>
  &quot;Some beings with unflagging resolution make themselves strong through 
  the use of thought-processes. When they have perfected thought and memory, they 
  are known as immortal with illumining conduct.<br>
  &quot;Some beings with unflagging resolution make themselves strong through 
  intercourse. When they have perfected to response, they are known as immortals 
  with essential conduct.<br>
  &quot;Some beings with unflagging resolution make themselves strong through 
  transformations and changes. When they have perfected their awakening, they 
  are known as immortals of absolute conduct.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, these are all people who smelt their minds but do not cultivate 
  proper enlightenment. They obtain some special principle of life and can live 
  for thousands or tens of thousands of years. They retire deep into the mountains 
  or onto islands in the sea and cut themselves off from the human realm. However, 
  they are still part of the turning wheel, because they flow and turn according 
  to their false thinking and do not cultivate Samadhi. When their reward is finished, 
  they must still return and enter the various destinies.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, there are many people in the world who do not seek what is eternal 
  and who cannot yet renounce the kindness and love they feel for their wives.<br>
  &quot;But they have no interest in deviant sexual activity and so develop a 
  purity and produce light. When their life ends, they draw near the sun and moon 
  and are among those born in the heaven of the Four Kings.<br>
  &quot;Those whose sexual love for their wives is slight, but who have not yet 
  obtained the entire flavor of dwelling in purity, transcend the light of sun 
  and moon at the end of their lives, and reside at the summit of the human realm. 
  They are among those born in the Tayastrimsha Heaven.<br>
  &quot;Those who become temporarily involved when they meet with desire but who 
  forget about it when it is finished, and who, while in the human realm, <br>
  are active less and quiet more, abide at the end of their lives in light and 
  emptiness where the illumination of sun and moon does not reach. These beings 
  have their own light, and they are among those born in the Suyama Heaven.<br>
  &quot;Those who are quiet all the time, but who are not yet able to resist when 
  stimulated by contact, ascend at the end of their lives to a subtle and ethereal 
  place; they will not be drawn into the lower realms. The destruction of the 
  realms of humans and gods and the obliteration of Kalpas by the Three Disasters 
  will not reach them, for they are among those born in the Tushita Heaven.<br>
  &quot;Those who are devoid of desire, but who will engage in it for the sake 
  of their partner, even though the flavor of doing so is like the flavor of chewing 
  wax, are born at the end of their lives in a place of transcending transformations. 
  They are among those born in the Heaven of Bliss by Transformation.<br>
  Those who have no kind of worldly thoughts while doing what worldly people do, 
  who are lucid and beyond such activity while involved in it, are capable at 
  the end of their lives of entirely transcending states where transformations 
  may be present and may be lacking. They are among those born in the Heaven of 
  the Comfort from Others' Transformations.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, thus it is that although they have transcended the physical in 
  these six heavens, the traces of their minds still become involved. For that 
  they will have to pay in person. These are called the Six Desire Heavens.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, all those in the world who cultivate their minds but do not avail 
  themselves of Dhyana and so have no wisdom, can only control their bodies so 
  as to not engage in sexual desire. Whether walking or sitting, or in their thoughts, 
  they are totally devoid of it. Since they do not give rise to defiling love, 
  they do not remain in the realm of desire. These people can, in response to 
  their thought, take on the bodies of Brahma beings. They are among those in 
  the Heaven of the Multitudes of Brahma.<br>
  &quot;In those whose hearts of desire have already been cast aside, the mind 
  apart from desire manifests. They have a fond regard for the rules of discipline 
  and delight in being in accord with them. These people can practice the Brahma 
  virtue at all times, and they are among those in the Heaven of the Ministers 
  of Brahma.<br>
  &quot;Those whose bodies and minds are wonderfully perfect, and whose awesome 
  deportment is not in the least deficient, are pure in the prohibitive precepts 
  and have a thorough understanding of them as well. At all times these people 
  can govern the Brahma multitudes as great Brahma lords, and they are among those 
  in the Great Brahma Heaven.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, those who flow to these three superior levels will not be oppressed 
  by any suffering or affliction. Although they have not developed proper Samadhi, 
  their minds are pure to the point that they are not moved by outflows. This 
  is called the first Dhyana.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, those beyond the Brahma heavens gather in and govern the Brahma 
  beings, for their Brahma conduct is perfect and fulfilled. Unmoving and with 
  settled minds, they produce light in profound stillness, and they are among 
  those in the Heaven of Lesser Light.<br>
  &quot;Those whose lights illumine each other in an endless dazzling blaze shine 
  throughout the realms of the ten directions so that everything becomes like 
  crystal. They are among those in the Heaven of Limitless Light.<br>
  &quot;Those who take in and hold the light to perfection accomplish the substance 
  of the teaching. Creating and transforming the purity into endless responses 
  and functions, they are among those in the Light-Sound Heaven.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, those who flow to these three superior levels will not be oppressed 
  by worries or vexations. Although they have not developed proper Samadhi, their 
  minds are pure to the point that they have subdued their coarser outflows. This 
  is called the second Dhyana.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, heavenly beings for whom the perfection of light has become sound 
  and who further open out the sound to disclose its wonder discover a subtler 
  level of practice. They penetrate to the bliss of still extinction and are among 
  those in the Heaven of Lesser Purity.<br>
  &quot;Those in whom the emptiness of purity manifests are led to discover its 
  boundlessness. Their bodies and minds experience light ease, and they accomplish 
  the bliss of still extinction. They are among those in the Heaven of Limitless 
  Purity.<br>
  &quot;Those for whom the world, the body, and the mind are all perfectly pure 
  have accomplished the virtue of purity, and a superior level emerges. They return 
  to the bliss of still extinction, and they are among those in the Heaven of 
  Pervasive Purity.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, those who flow to these three superior levels will be replete 
  with great compliance. Their bodies and minds are at peace, and they obtain 
  limitless bliss. Although they have not obtained proper Samadhi, the joy within 
  the tranquility of their minds is total. This is called the third Dhyana.<br>
  &quot;Moreover, Ananda, heavenly beings whose bodies and minds are not oppressed 
  put an end to the cause of suffering and realize that bliss is not permanent-that 
  sooner or later it will come to an end. Suddenly they simultaneously renounce 
  both thoughts of suffering and thoughts of bliss. Their coarse and heavy thoughts 
  are extinguished, and they give rise to the nature of purity and blessing. They 
  are among those in the Heaven of the Birth of Blessings.<br>
  &quot;Those whose renunciation of these thoughts is in perfect fusion gain a 
  purity of superior understanding. Within these unimpeded blessings they obtain 
  a wonderful compliance that extends to the bounds of the future. They are among 
  those in the Blessed Love Heaven. <br>
  &quot;Ananda, from that heaven there are two ways to go. Those who extend the 
  previous thought into limitless pure light, and who perfect and clarify their 
  blessings and virtue, cultivate and are certified to one of these dwellings. 
  They are among those in the Abundant Fruit Heaven.<br>
  &quot;Those who extend the previous thought into a dislike of both suffering 
  and bliss, so that the intensity of their thought to renounce them continues 
  without cease, will end up by totally renouncing the way. Their bodies and minds 
  will become extinct; their thoughts will become like dead ashes. For five hundred 
  aeons these beings will perpetuate the cause for production and extinction, 
  being unable to discover the nature which is neither produced nor extinguished. 
  During the first half of these aeons they will undergo extinction; during the 
  second half they will experience production. They are among those in the Heaven 
  of No Thought.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, those who flow to these four superior levels will not be moved 
  by any suffering or bliss in any world. Although this is not the unconditioned 
  or the true ground of non-moving, because they still have the thought of obtaining 
  something, their functioning is nonetheless quite advanced. This is called the 
  fourth Dhyana.<br>
  &quot;Beyond these, Ananda, are the Five Heavens of No Return. For those who 
  have completely cut off the nine categories of habits in the lower realms, neither 
  suffering nor bliss exists, and there is no regression to the lower levels. 
  All whose minds have achieved this renunciation dwell in these heavens together.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, those who have put an end to suffering and bliss and who do not 
  get involved in the contention between such thoughts are among those in the 
  Heaven of No Affliction.<br>
  &quot;Those who isolate their practice, whether in movement or in restraint, 
  investigating the baselessness of that involvement, are among those in the Heaven 
  of No Heat.<br>
  &quot;Those whose vision is wonderfully perfect and clear, view the realms of 
  the ten directions as free of defiling appearances and devoid of all dirt and 
  filth. They are among those in the Heaven of Good View.<br>
  &quot;Those whose subtle vision manifests as all their obstructions are refined 
  away are among those in the Heaven of Good Manifestation.<br>
  &quot;Those who reach the ultimately subtle level come to the end of the nature 
  of form and emptiness and enter into a boundless realm. They are among those 
  in the Heaven of Ultimate Form.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, those in the four Dhyanas, and even the rulers of the gods at 
  those four levels, can only pay their respects through having heard of the beings 
  in the Heavens of No Return; they cannot know them or see them, just as the 
  coarse people of the world cannot see the places where the Arhats abide in holy 
  Way-places deep in the wild and mountainous areas.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, in these eighteen heavens are those who practice only non-involvement, 
  and have not yet gotten rid of their shapes, as well as those who have reached 
  the level of no return. This is called the Form Realm.<br>
  &quot;Furthermore, Ananda, form this summit of the Form Realm there are also 
  two roads. Those who are intent upon renunciation discover wisdom. The light 
  of their wisdom becomes perfect and penetrating, so that they can transcend 
  the defiling realms accomplish Arhatship, and enter the Bodhisattva Vehicle. 
  They are among those called great Arhats who have turned their minds around.<br>
  &quot;Those who dwell in the thought of renunciation and who succeed in renunciation 
  and rejection, realize that their bodies are an obstacle. If they thereupon 
  obliterate the obstacle and enter into emptiness, they are among those at the 
  Station of Emptiness.<br>
  &quot;For those who have eradicated all obstacles, there is neither obstruction 
  nor extinction. Then there remains only the Alaya consciousness and half of 
  the subtle functions of the Manas. These beings are among those at the Station 
  of Boundless Consciousness.<br>
  &quot;Those who have already done away with emptiness and form eradicate the 
  conscious mind as well. In the extensive tranquility of the ten directions there 
  is nowhere at all to go. These beings are among those at the Station of Nothing 
  Whatsoever.<br>
  &quot;When the nature of their consciousness does not move, within extinction 
  they exhaustively investigate. Within the endless they discern the end of the 
  nature. It is as if it were there and yet not there, as if it were ended and 
  yet not ended. They are among those at the Station of Neither Thought nor Non-Thought.<br>
  &quot;These beings who delve exhaustively into emptiness, but never fathom the 
  principle of emptiness, go from the Heaven of No Return down this road which 
  is a dead end to sagehood. They are among those known as dull Arhats who do 
  not turn their minds around. Just like those in the Heaven of No Thought and 
  the heavens of externalists who become engrossed in emptiness and do not want 
  to come back, these beings are confused, prone to outflows, and ignorant. They 
  will accordingly enter the cycle of rebirth again.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, each and every being in all these heavens is ordinary. They are 
  still answerable for their Karmic retribution. When they have answered for their 
  debts, they must once again enter rebirth. The lords of these heavens, however, 
  are all Bodhisattvas who roam in Samadhi. They gradually progress in their practice 
  and make transferences to the way cultivated by all sages.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, these are the Four Heavens of Emptiness, where the bodies and 
  minds of the inhabitants are extinguished. The nature of concentration emerges, 
  and they are free of the Karmic retribution of form. This final group is called 
  the Formless Realm.<br>
  &quot;The beings in all of them have not understood the wonderful enlightenment 
  of the bright mind. Their accumulation of falseness brings into being false 
  existence in the three realms. Within them they falsely follow along and become 
  submerged in the seven destinies. As Pudgalas, they gather together with their 
  own species or kind.<br>
  &quot;Furthermore, Ananda, there are four categories of Asuras in the Triple 
  Realm.<br>
  &quot;Those in the path of ghosts who use their strength to protect the Dharma 
  and who can ride their spiritual penetrations to enter into emptiness are Asuras 
  born from eggs; they belong to the destiny of ghosts.<br>
  &quot;Those who have fallen in virtue and have been dismissed from the heavens 
  dwell in places near the sun and moon. They are Asuras born from wombs and belong 
  to the destiny of humans.<br>
  &quot;There are Asura kings who uphold the world with a penetrating power and 
  fearlessness. They fight for position with the Brahma lord, the god Sharkra, 
  and the Four Heavenly Kings. These Asuras come into being by transformation 
  and belong to the destiny of gods.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, there is another, baser category of Asuras. They have thoughts 
  of the great seas and live submerged in underwater caves. During the day they 
  roam in emptiness; at night they return to their watery realm. These Asuras 
  come into being because of moisture and belong to the destiny of animals.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, so it is that when the seven destinies of hell-dwellers, hungry 
  ghosts, animals, people, spiritual immortals, gods, and Asuras are investigated 
  in detail, they are all found to be murky and embroiled in <br>
  conditioned existence. Their births come from false thoughts. Their subsequent 
  Karma comes from false thoughts. Within the wonderful perfection of the fundamental 
  mind that is without any doing, they are like strange flowers in space, for 
  there is basically nothing to be attached to; they are entirely vain and false, 
  and they have no source or beginning.<br>
  &quot;Ananda, these living beings, who do not recognize the fundamental mind, 
  all undergo rebirth for limitless Kalpas. They do not attain true purity, because 
  they keep getting involved in killing, stealing, and lust, or because they counter 
  them and are born according to their not killing, not stealing, and lack of 
  lust. If these three Karmas are present in them, they are born among the troops 
  of ghosts. If they are free of these three Karmas, they are born in the destiny 
  of gods. The incessant fluctuation between the presence and absence of these 
  Karmas gives rise to the cycle of rebirth.<br>
  &quot;For those who make the wonderful discovery of Samadhi, neither the presence 
  nor the absence of these Karmas exists in that magnificent, eternal stillness; 
  even their non-existence is done away with. Since the lack of killing, stealing, 
  and lust is non-existent, how could there be actual involvement in deeds of 
  killing, stealing, and lust?<br>
  &quot;Ananda, those who do not cut off the three Karmas each have their own 
  private share. Because each has a private share, private shares come to be accumulated, 
  making collective portions. Their location is not arbitrary, yet they themselves 
  are falsely produced. Since they are produced from falseness, they are basically 
  without a cause, and thus they cannot be traced precisely.<br>
  &quot;You should warn cultivators that they must get rid of these three delusions 
  if they want to cultivate Bodhi. If they do not put an end to these three delusion, 
  them even the spiritual penetrations they may attain are merely a worldly, conditioned 
  function. If they do not extinguish these habits, they will fall into the path 
  of demons.<br>
  &quot;Although they wish to cast out the false, they become doubly deceptive 
  instead. The Thus Come Ones says that such beings are pitiful, you have created 
  this falseness yourself; it is not the fault of Bodhi.<br>
  &quot;An explanation such as this is proper speech. Any other explanation is 
  the speech of demon kings.&quot;</b></p>

  <b>VOLUME 8<br></b>
  INTRODUCTION<br>
  At that time, the Tathagata was preparing to leave the Dharma-seat. From the 
  lion throne, he extended his hand and placed it on a small table wrought of 
  the seven precious things. But then he turned his body, which was the color 
  of purple-golden mountains, and leaned back, saying to everyone in the assembly 
  and to Ananda: Those of you with More to Learn, those Enlightened by Conditions, 
  and those who are Hearers have now turned your minds to pursue the attainment 
  of supreme Bodhi-the unsurpassed, wonderful enlightenment. I have already taught 
  you the true method of cultivation.<br>
  You are still not aware of the subtle demonic events that can occur when you 
  cultivate Shamatha and Vipashyana. If you cannot recognize a demonic state when 
  it appears, it is because the cleansing of your mind has not been proper. You 
  will then be engulfed by deviant views.<br>
  You may be troubled by a demon from your own Skandhas or a demon from the heavens. 
  Or you may be possessed by a ghost or spirit, or you may encounter a Li-ghost 
  or a Mei-ghost. If your mind is not clear, you will mistake a thief for your 
  own son.<br>
  It is also possible to feel satisfied after a small accomplishment, like the 
  unlearned Bhikshu who reached the Fourth Dhyana and claimed that he had realized 
  sagehood. When his celestial reward ended and the signs of decay appeared, he 
  slandered Arhatship as being subject to birth and death, and thus he feel into 
  the Avichi Hell.<br>
  You should pay attention. I will now explain this for you in detail.<br>
  Ananda stood up and, with the others in the assembly who had more to learn, 
  bowed joyfully. They quieted themselves in order to listen to the compassionate 
  instruction.<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda and the whole assembly: You should know that the twelve 
  categories of beings in this world of outflows are endowed with a wonderfully 
  bright, fundamental enlightenment-the enlightened, perfect substance of the 
  mind which is not different from that of the Buddhas of the ten directions.<br>
  Due to the fault of false thinking and confusion about the truth, infatuation 
  arises and makes your confusion all-pervasive. Consequently, an emptiness appears. 
  Worlds come into being as that confusion is ceaselessly transformed. Therefore, 
  the lands that are not without outflows, as numerous as motes of dust throughout 
  the ten directions, are all created as a result of confusion, dullness, and 
  false thinking.<br>
  You should know that the space created in your mind is like a wisp of cloud 
  that dots the vast sky. How much smaller must all the worlds within that space 
  be!<br>
  If even one person among you finds the truth and returns to the source, then 
  all of space in the ten directions is obliterated. How could the worlds within 
  that space fail to be destroyed as well?<br>
  When you cultivate Dhyana and attain Samadhi, your mind tallies with the minds 
  of the Bodhisattvas and the great Arhats of the ten directions who are free 
  of outflows, and you abide in a state of profound purity.<br>
  All the kings of demons, the ghosts and spirits, and the ordinary gods see their 
  palaces collapse for no apparent reason. The earth quakes, and all the creatures 
  in the water, on the land, and in the air, without exception, are frightened. 
  Yet ordinary people who are sunk in dim confusion remain unaware of these changes.<br>
  All these beings have five kinds of spiritual powers; they lack only freedom 
  from outflows, because they are still attached to worldly passions. How could 
  they allow you to destroy their palaces? That is why the ghosts, spirits, celestial 
  demons, sprites, and goblins come to disturb you when you are in Samadhi.<br>
  Although these demons posses tremendous enmity they are in the grip of their 
  worldly passions, while you are within wonderful enlightenment. They cannot 
  affect you any more than a blowing wind can affect light or a knife can cut 
  through water. You are like boiling water, while the demons are like solid ice 
  which, in the presence of heat, soon melts away. Since they rely exclusively 
  on spiritual powers, they are like mere guests.<br>
  They can succeed in their destructiveness through your mind, which is the host 
  of the five Skandhas. If the host becomes confused, the guests will be able 
  to do as they please.<br>
  When you are in Dhyana, awakened, aware, and free of delusion, their demonic 
  deeds can do nothing to you. As the Skandhas dissolve, you enter the light. 
  All those deviant hordes depend upon dark energy. Since light can destroy darkness, 
  they would be destroyed if they drew near you. How could they dare linger and 
  try to disrupt your Dhyana-Samadhi?<br>
  If you were not clear and aware, but were confused by the Skandhas, then you, 
  Ananda, would surely become one of the demons; you would turn into a demonic 
  being.<br>
  Your encounter with Matangi's daughter was a minor incident. She cast a spell 
  on you to make you break the Buddha;s moral precepts. Still, among the eighty 
  thousand modes of conduct, you violated only one precept. Because your mind 
  was pure, all was not lost.<br>
  This would be an attempt to completely destroy your precious enlightenment. 
  Were it to succeed, you would become like the family of a senior government 
  official who is suddenly exiled; his family wanders, bereft and alone, with 
  no one to pity or rescue them.<br>
  FORM SKANDHA<br>
  Ananda, you should know that as a cultivator sits in the Bodhimanda, he is doing 
  away with all thoughts. When his thoughts come to an end, there will be nothing 
  on his mind. This state of pure clarity will stay the same whether in movement 
  or stillness, in remembrance or forgetfulness.<br>
  When he dwells in this place and enters Samadhi, he is like a person with clear 
  vision who finds himself in total darkness. Although his nature is wonderfully 
  pure, his mind is not yet illuminated. This is the region of the form Skandha.<br>
  If his eyes become clear, he will then experience the ten directions as an open 
  expanse, and the darkness will be gone. This is the end of the form Skandha. 
  He will then be able to transcend the turbidity of Kalpas. Contemplating the 
  cause of the form Skandha, one sees that false thoughts of solidity are its 
  source.<br>
  Ananda, at this point, as the person intently investigates that wondrous brightness, 
  the four elements will no longer function together, and soon the body will be 
  able to transcend obstructions. This state is called &quot;the pure brightness 
  merging into the environment.&quot; It is a temporary state in the course of 
  cultivation and does not indicate sagehood. If he does not think he has become 
  a sage, then this will be a good state. But if he considers himself a sage, 
  then he will be vulnerable to the demons' influence.<br>
  Further, Ananda, as the person uses his mind to intently investigate that wondrous 
  light, the light will pervade his body. Suddenly he will be able to extract 
  intestinal worms from his own body, yet his body will remain intact and unharmed. 
  This state is called &quot;the pure light surging through one's physical body.&quot; 
  It is a temporary state in the course of intensive pracrtice, and does not indicate 
  sagehood. If he does not think he has become a sage, then this will be a good 
  state. But if he considers himself a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the 
  demons' influence.<br>
  Further, as the person uses his mind to intently investigate inside and outside, 
  his physical and spiritual souls, intellect, will, essence, and spirit will 
  be able to interact with one another without affecting his body. They will take 
  turns as host and guests. Then he may suddenly hear the Dharma being spoken 
  in space, or perhaps he will hear esoteric truths being pronounced simultaneously 
  throughout the ten directions. This state is called &quot;the essence and souls 
  alternately separating and uniting, and the planting of good seeds.&quot; It 
  is a temporary state and does not indicate sagehood. If he does not think he 
  has become a sage, then this will be a good state. But if he considers himself 
  a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the demons' influence.<br>
  Further, when the person's mind becomes clear, unveiled, bright, and penetrating, 
  an internal light will shine forth and turn everything in the ten directions 
  into the color of Jambu-river gold. All the various species of beings will be 
  transformed into Tathagatas. Suddenly he will see Vairochana Buddha seated upon 
  a platform of celestial light, surrounded by a thousand Buddhas, who simultaneously 
  appear upon lotus blossoms in a hundred million lands. This state is called 
  &quot;the mind and soul being instilled with spiritual awareness.&quot; When 
  he has investigated to the point of clarity, the light of his mind will shine 
  upon all worlds. This is a temporary state and does not indicate sagehood. If 
  he does not think he has become a sage, then this will be a good state. But 
  if he considers himself a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the demons' influence.<br>
  Further, as the person uses his mind to intently investigate that wondrous light, 
  he will contemplate without pause, restraining and subduing his mind so that 
  it does not go to extremes. Suddenly the space in the ten directions may take 
  on the colors of the seven precious things or the colors of a hundred precious 
  things, which simultaneously pervade everywhere without hindering one another. 
  The blues, yellows, reds, and whites will each be clearly apparent. This state 
  is called &quot;excessively subduing the mind.&quot; It is a temporary state 
  and does not indicate sagehood. If he does not think he has become a sage, then 
  this will be a good state. But if he considers himself a sage, then he will 
  be vulnerable to the demons' influence.<br>
  Further, as the person uses his mind to investigate with clear discernment until 
  the pure light no longer disperses, he will suddenly be able to see various 
  things appear in a dark room at night, just as if it were daytime, while the 
  objects that were already in the room do not disappear. This state is called 
  &quot;refining the mind and purifying the vision until one is able to see in 
  the dark.&quot; It is a temporary state and does not indicate sagehood. If he 
  does not think he has become a sage, then this will be a good state. But if 
  he considers himself a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the demons' influence.<br>
  Further, when his mind completely merges with emptiness, his four limbs will 
  suddenly become like grass or wood, devoid of sensation even when burned by 
  fire or cut with a knife. The burning of fire will not make his limbs hot, and 
  even when his flesh is cut, it will be like wood being whittled. This state 
  is called &quot;the merging of external states and the blending of the four 
  elements into a uniform substance.&quot; It is a temporary state and does not 
  indicate sagehood. If he does not think he has become a sage, then this will 
  be a good state. But if he considers himself a sage, then he will be vulnerable 
  to the demon's influence.<br>
  Further, when his mind accomplishes such purity that his skill in purifying 
  the mind has reached its ultimate, he will suddenly see the earth, the mountains, 
  and the rivers in the ten directions turn into Buddhalands replete with the 
  seven precious things, their light shining everywhere. He will also see Buddhas, 
  Tathagatas, as many as the sands of the Ganges, filling all of space. He will 
  also see pavilions and palaces that are resplendent and beautiful. He will see 
  the hells below and the celestial palaces above, all without obstruction. This 
  state is called &quot;the gradual transformation of concentrated thoughts of 
  fondness and loathing.&quot; It does not indicate sagehood. If he does not think 
  he has become a sage, then this will be a good state. But if he considers himself 
  a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the demons' influence.<br>
  Further, as the person uses his mind to investigate what is profound and far 
  away, he will suddenly be able to see distant places in the middle of the night. 
  He will see city markets and community wells, streets and alleys, and relatives 
  and friends, and he may hear their conversations. This state is called &quot;having 
  been suppressed to the utmost, the mind flies out and sees much that had been 
  blocked from view.&quot; It does not indicate sagehood. If he does not think 
  he has become a sage, then this will be a good state. But if he considers himself 
  a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the demons' influence.<br>
  Further, as the person uses his mind to investigate to the utmost point, he 
  may see a Good and Wise Advisor whose body undergoes changes. Within a brief 
  interval, various transformations will occur which cannot be explained. This 
  state is called &quot;having an improper mind which is possessed by a Li-ghost, 
  a Mei-ghost, or a celestial demon, and without reason speaking Dharma that fathoms 
  wondrous truths.&quot; It does not indicate sagehood. If he does not think he 
  has become a sage, then the demonic formations will subside. But if he considers 
  himself a sage, then he will be vulnerable to the demons' influence.<br>
  Ananda, these ten states may occur in Dhyana as one's mental effort interacts 
  with the form Skandha.<br>
  Dull and confused living beings do not evaluate themselves. Encountering such 
  situations, in their confusion they fail to recognize them and say that they 
  have become sages, thereby uttering a great lie. They will fall into the Relentless 
  Hells.<br>
  In the Dharma-ending Age, after the Tathagata enters Nirvana, all of you should 
  rely on and proclaim this teaching. Do not let the demons of the heavens have 
  their way. Offer protection so all can realize the unsurpassed Way.<br>
  FEELING SKANDHA<br>
  Ananda, when the good person who is cultivating Samadhi and Shamatha has put 
  an end to the form Skandha, he can see the mind of all Buddhas as if seeing 
  an image reflected in a clear mirror.<br>
  He seems to have obtained something, but he cannot use it. In this he resembles 
  a paralyzed person. His hands and feet are intact, his seeing and hearing are 
  not distorted, and yet his mind has come under a deviant influence, so that 
  he is unable to move. This is the region of the feeling Skandha.<br>
  Once the problem of paralysis subsides, his mind can then leave his body and 
  look back upon his face. It can go or stay as it pleases without further hindrance. 
  This is the end of the feeling Skandha. This person can then transcend the turbidity 
  of views. Contemplating the cause of the feeling Skandha, one sees that false 
  thoughts of illusory clarity are its source.<br>
  Ananda, in this situation the good person experiences a brilliant light. As 
  a result of the excessive internal pressure in his mind, he is suddenly overwhelmed 
  with such boundless sadness that he looks upon even mosquitoes and gadflies 
  as newborn children. He is filled with pity and unconsciously bursts into tears.<br>
  This is called &quot;overexertion in suppressing the mind in the course of cultivation.&quot; 
  If he understands, then there is no error. This experience does not indicate 
  sagehood. If he realizes that and remains unconfused, then after a time it will 
  disappear. But if he considers himself a sage, then a demon of sadness will 
  enter his mind. Then, as soon as he sees someone, he will feel sad and cry uncontrollably. 
  Lacking proper Samadhi, he will certainly fall.<br>
  Further, Ananda, in this state of Samadhi, the good person sees the disintegration 
  of the form Skandha and understands the feeling Skandha. At that time he has 
  a sublime vision and is overwhelmed with gratitude. In this situation, he suddenly 
  evinces tremendous courage. His mind is bold and keen. He resolves to equal 
  all Buddhas and says he can transcend three Asamkhyeyas of eons in a single 
  thought.<br>
  This is called &quot;being too anxious to excel in cultivation.&quot; If he 
  understands, then there is no error. This experience does not indicate sagehood. 
  If he realizes that and remains unconfused, then after a time it will disappear. 
  But if he considers himself a sage, then a demon of sadness will enter his mind. 
  Then, as soon as he sees someone, he will feel sad and cry uncontrollably. Lacking 
  proper Samadhi he will certainly fall..<br>
  Further, in this state of Samadhi the good person sees the disintegration of 
  the form Skandha and understands the feeling Skandha. With no new realization 
  immediately ahead of him, and having lost his former status as well, his power 
  of wisdom weakens, and he enters an impasse in which he sees nothing to anticipate. 
  Suddenly a feeling of tremendous monotony and thirst arises in his mind. At 
  all times he is fixated in memories that do not disperse. He mistakes this for 
  a sign of diligence and vigor.<br>
  This is called &quot;cultivating the mind but losing oneself due to a lack of 
  wisdom.&quot; If he understands, then there is no error. This experience does 
  not indicate sagehood. But if he considers himself a sage, then a demon of memory 
  will enter his mind. Day and night it will hold his mind suspended in one place. 
  Lacking proper Samadhi, he will certainly fall.<br>
  Further, in this state of Samadhi, the good person sees the disintegration of 
  the form Skandha and understands the feeling Skandha. His wisdom becomes stronger 
  than his Samadhi, and he mistakenly becomes impetuous. Cherishing the supremacy 
  of his nature, he imagines that he is a Nishyanda (Buddha) and rests content 
  with his minor achievement.<br>
  This is called &quot;applying the mind, but straying away from constant examination 
  and becoming preoccupied with ideas and opinions.&quot; If he understands, then 
  there is no error. This experience does not indicate sagehood. But if he considers 
  himself a sage, then a lowly demon that is easily satisfied will enter his mind. 
  As soon as he sees someone, he will announce, &quot;I have realized the unsurpassed 
  absolute truth.&quot; Lacking proper Samadhi, he will certainly fall.<br>
  Further, in this state of Samadhi the good person sees the disintegration of 
  the form Skandha and understands the feeling Skandha. He has not yet obtained 
  any results, and his prior state of mind has already disappeared. Surveying 
  the two extremes, he feels that he is in great danger. Suddenly he becomes greatly 
  distraught, as if he were seated on the Iron Bed, or as if he has taken poison. 
  He has no wish to go on living, and he is always asking people to take his life 
  so he can be released sooner.<br>
  This is called &quot;cultivating, but not understanding expedients.&quot; If 
  he understands, then there is no error. This experience does not indicate sagehood. 
  But if he considers himself a sage, then a demon of chronic depression will 
  enter his mind. He may take up knives and swords and cut his own flesh, happily 
  giving up his life. Or else, driven by constant anxiety, he may flee into the 
  wilderness and be unwilling to see people. Lacking proper Samadhi, he will certainly 
  fall.<br>
  Further, in this state of Samadhi, the good person sees the disintegration of 
  the form Skandha and understands the feeling Skandha. As he dwells in this purity, 
  his mind is tranquil and at ease. Suddenly a feeling of boundless joy wells 
  up in him. There is such bliss in his mind that he cannot contain it.<br>
  This is called, &quot;experiencing lightness and ease, but lacking the wisdom 
  to control it.&quot; If he understands, then there is no error. This experience 
  does not indicate sagehood. But if he considers himself a sage, then a demon 
  that likes happiness will enter his mind. As soon as he sees someone, he will 
  laugh. He will sing and dance in the streets. He will say that he has already 
  attained unobstructed liberation. Lacking proper Samadhi, he will certainly 
  fall.<br>
  Further, in this state of Samadhi, the good person sees the disintegration of 
  the form Skandha and understands the feeling Skandha. He says he is already 
  satisfied. Suddenly, a feeling of unreasonable, intense self-satisfaction may 
  arise in him. It may include pride, outrageous pride, haughty pride, overweening 
  pride, and pride based on inferiority, all of which occur at once. In his mind, 
  he even looks down on the Tathagatas of the ten directions, how much the more 
  so on the lesser positions of Hearers and Those Enlightened by Conditions.<br>
  This is called &quot;viewing oneself as supreme, but lacking the wisdom to save 
  oneself.&quot; If he understands, then there is no error. This experience does 
  not indicate sagehood. But if he considers himself a sage, then a demon of intense 
  arrogance will enter his mind. He will not bow to stupas or in temples. He will 
  destroy Sutras and images. He will say to the Danapatis, &quot;these are gold, 
  bronze, clay, or wood. The Sutras are just leaves or cloth. The flesh body is 
  what is real and eternal, but you don't revere it; instead you venerate clay 
  and faith in him will follow him to destroy the images or bury them. He will 
  mislead living beings so that they fall into the Relentless Hells. Lacking proper 
  Samadhi, he will certainly fall.<br>
  Further, in this state of Samadhi, the good person sees the disintegration of 
  the form Skandha and understands the feeling Skandha. In this refined understanding, 
  he awakens completely to subtle principles. Everything is in accord with his 
  wishes. He may suddenly experience limitless lightness and ease in his mind. 
  He may say that he has become a sage and attained great self-mastery. This is 
  called &quot;attaining lightless and clarity due to wisdom.&quot; If he understands, 
  then there is no error. This experience does not indicate sagehood.<br>
  But if he considers himself a sage, then a demon that likes lightness and clarity 
  will enter his mind. Claiming that he is already satisfied, he will not strive 
  to make further progress. For the most part, such cultivators will become like 
  the Unlearned Bhikshu. He will mislead living beings so that they will fall 
  into the Avichi Hell. Lacking proper Samadhi, he will certainly fall.<br>
  Further in this state it Samadhi, the good person sees the disintegration of 
  the form Skandha and understands the feeling Skandha. In that clear awakening, 
  he experiences an illusory clarity. Within that, suddenly he may veer towards 
  the view of eternal extinction, deny cause and effect, and take everything as 
  empty. The thought of emptiness so predominates that he comes to believe that 
  there is eternal extinction after death. [This is called &quot; the mental state 
  of Samadhi dissolving so that one loses sight of what is right.&quot;] If he 
  understands, then there is no error. This experience does not indicate sagehood.<br>
  But if he considers himself a sage, then a demon of emptiness will enter his 
  mind. He will slander the holding of precepts, calling it a &quot;Small Vehicle 
  Dharma.&quot; He will say, &quot;Since Bodhisattvas have awakened to emptiness, 
  what is there to hold or violate?&quot; this person, in the presence of his 
  faithful Danapatis, will often drink wine, eat meat, and engage in wanton lust. 
  The power of the demon will keep his followers from doubting or denouncing him. 
  After the ghost has possessed him for a long time, he may consume excrement 
  and urine, or meat and wine, claiming that all such things are empty. He will 
  break the Buddha's moral precepts and mislead people into committing offenses. 
  Lacking proper Samadhi, he will certainly fall.<br>
  Further, in this state of Samadhi, the good person sees the disintegration of 
  the form Skandha and understands the feeling Skandha. He savors the state of 
  illusory clarity, and it deeply enters his mind and bones. Boundless love may 
  suddenly well forth from his mind. When that love becomes extreme, he goes insane 
  with greed and lust. This is called &quot;when an agreeable state of Samadhi 
  enters one's mind, lacking the wisdom to control oneself and mistakenly engaging 
  in lustful behavior.&quot; If he understands, then there is no error. This experience 
  does not indicate sagehood. <br>
  But if he considers himself a sage, then a demon of desire will enter his mind. 
  He will become an outspoken advocate of lust, calling it the Way to Bodhi. He 
  will teach his lay followers to indiscriminately engage in acts of lust, calling 
  those who commit acts of lust his Dharma heirs. The power of spirits and ghosts 
  in the Ending Age will enable him to attract a following of ordinary, naive 
  people numbering one hundred, two hundred, five or six hundred, or as many as 
  one thousand or ten thousand. When the demon becomes bored, it will leave the 
  person's body. Once the person's charisma is gone, he will run afoul of the 
  law. He will mislead living beings, so that they fall into the Relentless Hells. 
  Lacking proper Samadhi, he will certainly fall.<br>
  Ananda, all ten of these states may occur in Dhyana as one's mental effort interacts 
  with the feeling Skandha. Dull and confused living beings do not evaluate themselves. 
  Encountering such situations, in their confusion they fail to recognize them 
  and say that they have become sages, thereby uttering a great lie. They will 
  fall into the Relentless Hells.<br>
  In the Dharma-ending Age, after my Nirvana, all of you should pass on the Tathagata's 
  teachings, so that all living beings can awaken to their meaning. Do not let 
  the demons of the heavens have their way. Offer protection so that all can realize 
  the unsurpassed Way.<br>
  THINKING SKANDHA<br>
  Ananda, when the good person who is cultivating Samadhi has put an end to the 
  feeling Skandha, although he has not achieved freedom from outflows, his mind 
  can leave his body the way a bird escapes from a cage. From within his ordinary 
  body, he already has the potential for ascending through the Bodhisattvas' sixty 
  levels of sagehood. He attains the &quot;body produced by intent&quot; and can 
  roam freely without obstruction. <br>
  This is like someone talking in his sleep. Although he does not know he is doing 
  it, his words are clear, and his voice and inflection are all in order, so those 
  who are awake can understand what he is saying. This is the region of the thinking 
  Skandha. <br>
  If he puts an end to his stirring thoughts and rids himself of superfluous thinking, 
  it is as if he has purged defilement from the enlightened, understanding mind. 
  Then he is perfectly clear about the births and deaths of all categories of 
  beings from beginning to end. This is the end of the thinking Skandha. He can 
  then transcend the turbidity of afflictions. Contemplating the cause of the 
  thinking Skandha, one sees that interconnected false thoughts are its source. 
  <br>
  Ananda, in the unhindered clarity and wonder that ensues after the feeling Skandha 
  is gone, this good person is untroubled by any deviant mental state and experiences 
  perfect, bright concentration. Within Samadhi, his mind craves its perfect brightness, 
  so he sharpens his concentrated thought as he greedily seeks for cleverness 
  and skill. <br>
  At that time a demon from the heavens seizes the opportunity it has been waiting 
  for. Its spirit possesses another person and uses him as a mouthpiece to expound 
  the Sutras and the Dharma.<br>
  This person, unaware that he is possessed by a demon, claims he has reached 
  unsurpassed Nirvana. When he comes to see that good person who seeks cleverness 
  and skill, he arranges a seat and speaks the Dharma. In an instant, he may appear 
  to be a Bhikshu, enabling that person to see him as such, or he may appear as 
  Shakra, as a woman, or as a Bhikshuni; or his body may emit light as he sleeps 
  in a dark room. <br>
  The good person is beguiled and fooled into thinking that the other is a Bodhisattva. 
  He believes the other's teachings and his mind is swayed. He breaks the Buddha's 
  moral precepts and covertly indulges his greedy desires. <br>
  The other person is fond of speaking about calamities, auspicious events, and 
  unusual changes. He may say that a Tathagata has appeared in the world at a 
  certain place. He may speak of catastrophic fires or wars, thus frightening 
  people into squandering their family wealth without reason. <br>
  This is a strange ghost that in its old age has become a demon. It disturbs 
  and confuses the good person. But when it tires of doing so, it will leave the 
  other person's body. Then both the disciples and the teacher will get in trouble 
  with the law. <br>
  You should be aware of this in advance and not get caught up in the cycle of 
  transmigration. If you are confused and do not understand, you will fall into 
  the Relentless Hells. <br>
  Further, Ananda, in the unhindered clarity and wonder that ensues after the 
  feeling Skandha is gone, this good person is untroubled by any deviant mental 
  state and experiences perfect, bright concentration. Within Samadhi, his mind 
  craves to roam about, so he lets his subtle thoughts fly out as he greedily 
  seeks for adventure.<br>
  At that time a demon from the heavens seizes the opportunity it has been waiting 
  for. Its spirit possesses another person and uses him as a mouthpiece to expound 
  the Sutras and the Dharma. <br>
  This person, unaware that he is possessed by a demon, claims he has reached 
  unsurpassed Nirvana. When he comes to see that good person who seeks to roam, 
  he arranges a seat and speaks the Dharma. His own body does not change its appearance, 
  but those listening to the Dharma suddenly see themselves sitting on jeweled 
  lotuses and their entire bodies transformed into clusters of purple-golden light. 
  Each person in the audience experiences that state and feels he has obtained 
  something unprecedented. <br>
  The good person is beguiled and fooled into thinking the other is a Bodhisattva. 
  Lust and laxity corrupt his mind. He breaks the Buddha's moral precepts and 
  covertly indulges his greedy desires. <br>
  The other person is fond of saying that Buddhas are appearing in the world. 
  He claims that in a certain place a certain person is actually a transformation 
  body of a certain Buddha. Or he says that a certain person is such and such 
  a Bodhisattva who has come to teach humankind. People who witness this are filled 
  with admiration. Their wrong views multiply, and their Wisdom of Modes is destroyed. 
  <br>
  This is a drought ghost that in its old age has become a demon. It disturbs 
  and confuses the good person. But when it tires of doing so, it will leave the 
  other person's body. Then both the disciples and the teacher will get in trouble 
  with the law.<br>
  You should be aware of this in advance and not get caught up in the cycle of 
  transmigration. If you are confused and do not understand, you will fall into 
  the Relentless Hells. <br>
  Further, in the unhindered clarity and wonder that ensues after the feeling 
  Skandha is gone, this good person is untroubled by any deviant mental state 
  and experiences perfect, bright concentration. Within Samadhi, his mind craves 
  spiritual oneness, so he clarifies his concentrated thought as he greedily seeks 
  for union. <br>
  At that time a demon from the heavens seizes the opportunity it has been waiting 
  for. Its spirit possesses another person and uses him as a mouthpiece to expound 
  the Sutras and the Dharma. <br>
  This person, unaware that he is actually possessed by a demon, claims he has 
  reached unsurpassed Nirvana. When he comes to see that good person who seeks 
  union, he arranges a seat and speaks the Dharma. Neither his own body nor the 
  bodies of those listening to the Dharma go through any external transformations. 
  But he makes the minds of the listeners become &quot;Enlightened&quot; before 
  they listen to the Dharma, so they experience changes in every thought. They 
  may have the knowledge of past lives or the knowledge of others' thoughts. They 
  may see the hells or know all the good and evil events in the human realm. They 
  may speak verses or spontaneously recite Sutras. Each person is elated and feels 
  he has obtained something unprecedented. <br>
  The good person is beguiled and fooled into thinking the other is a Bodhisattva. 
  His thoughts become entangled in love. He breaks the Buddha's moral precepts 
  and covertly indulges his greedy desires. <br>
  He is fond of saying that there are greater Buddhas and lesser Buddhas, earlier 
  Buddhas and later Buddhas; that among them are true Buddhas and false Buddhas, 
  male Buddhas and female Buddhas; and that the same is true of Bodhisattvas. 
  When people witness this, their initial resolve is washed away, and they easily 
  get carried away with their wrong understanding. <br>
  This is a Mei-ghost that in its old age has become a demon. It disturbs and 
  confuses the good person. But when it tires of doing so, it will leave the other 
  person's body. Then both the disciples and the teacher will get in trouble with 
  the law. <br>
  You should be aware of this in advance and not get caught up in the cycle of 
  transmigration. If you are confused and do not understand, you will fall into 
  the Relentless Hells. <br>
  Further, in the unhindered clarity and wonder that ensues after the feeling 
  Skandha is gone, this good person is untroubled by any deviant mental state 
  and experiences perfect, bright concentration. Within Samadhi, his mind craves 
  to know the origins of things, so he exhaustively investigates the nature of 
  physical things and their changes from beginning to end. He intensifies the 
  keenness of his thoughts as he greedily seeks to analyze things. <br>
  At that time a demon from the heavens seizes the opportunity it has been waiting 
  for. Its spirit possesses another person and uses him as a mouthpiece to expound 
  the Sutras and the Dharma. <br>
  This person, unaware that he is possessed by a demon, claims he has reached 
  unsurpassed Nirvana. When he comes to see that good person who seeks to know 
  the origins of things, he arranges a seat and speaks the Dharma. His body has 
  an awesome spiritual quality, which subdues the seeker. He makes the minds of 
  those gathered beside his seat spontaneously compliant, even before they have 
  heard the Dharma. He says to all those people that the Buddha's Nirvana, Bodhi, 
  and Dharma-body are there before them in the form of his own physical body. 
  He says, &quot;The successive begetting of fathers and sons from generation 
  to generation is itself the Dharma-body, which is permanent and never-ending. 
  What you see right now are those very Buddhalands. There are no other pure dwellings 
  or golden features.&quot;<br>
  Those people believe and accept his words, forgetting their initial resolve. 
  They offer up their lives, feeling they have obtained something unprecedented. 
  They are all beguiled and confused into thinking he is a Bodhisattva. As they 
  pursue his ideas, they break the Buddha's moral precepts and covertly indulge 
  their greedy desires. <br>
  He is fond of saying that the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue are the Pure Land, 
  and that the male and female organs are the true place of Bodhi and Nirvana. 
  Ignorant people believe these filthy words. <br>
  This is a poisonous ghost or an evil paralysis ghost that in its old age has 
  become a demon. It disturbs and confuses the good person. But when it tires 
  of doing so, it will leave the other person's body. Then both the disciples 
  and the teacher will get in trouble with the law.<br>
  You should be aware of this in advance and not get caught up in the cycle of 
  transmigration. If you are confused and do not understand, you will fall into 
  the Relentless Hells. <br>
  Further, in the unhindered clarity and wonder that ensues after the feeling 
  Skandha is gone, this good person is untroubled by any deviant mental state 
  and experiences perfect, bright concentration. Within Samadhi, his mind craves 
  revelations from afar, so he pours all his energy into this intense investigation 
  as he greedily seeks for imperceptible spiritual responses. <br>
  At that time a demon from the heavens seizes the opportunity it has been waiting 
  for. Its spirit possesses another person and uses him as a mouthpiece to expound 
  the Sutras and the Dharma. <br>
  This person, completely unaware that he is possessed by a demon, claims he has 
  reached unsurpassed Nirvana. When he comes to see that good person who seeks 
  revelations, he arranges a seat and speaks the Dharma. He briefly appears to 
  his listeners in a body that looks a hundred or a thousand years old. They experience 
  a defiling love for him and cannot bear to part with him. They personally act 
  as his servants, tirelessly making the Four Kinds of Offerings to him. Each 
  member of the assembly believes that this person is his former teacher, his 
  original Good and Wise Advisor. They give rise to love for his Dharma and stick 
  to him as if glued, feeling they have obtained something unprecedented. <br>
  The good person is beguiled and fooled into thinking the other is a Bodhisattva. 
  Attracted to the other's thinking, he breaks the Buddha's moral precepts and 
  covertly indulges his greedy desires. <br>
  He is fond of saying, in a past life, in a certain incarnation, I rescued a 
  certain person who was then my wife (or my mistress, or my brother). Now I have 
  come to rescue you again. We will stay together and go to another world to make 
  offerings to a certain Buddha.&quot; Or he may say, &quot;There is a Heaven 
  of Great Brilliance where a Buddha now dwells. It is the resting place of all 
  Tathagatas. Ignorant people believe his ravings and lose their original resolve. 
  <br>
  This is a pestilence ghost that in its old age has become a demon. It disturbs 
  and confuses the good person. But when it tires of doing so, it will leave the 
  other person's body. Then both the disciples and the teacher will get in trouble 
  with the law. <br>
  You should be aware of this in advance and not get caught up in the cycle of 
  transmigration. If you are confused and do not understand, you will fall into 
  the Relentless Hells. <br>
  Further, in the unhindered clarity and wonder that ensues after the feeling 
  Skandha is gone, this good person is untroubled by any deviant mental state 
  and experiences perfect, bright concentration. Within Samadhi, his mind craves 
  deep absorption, so he restrains himself with energetic diligence and likes 
  to dwell in secluded places as he greedily seeks for peace and quiet. <br>
  At that time a demon from the heavens seizes the opportunity it has been waiting 
  for. Its spirit possesses another person and uses him as a mouthpiece to expound 
  the Sutras and the Dharma. <br>
  This person, unaware that he is possessed by a demon, claims he has reached 
  unsurpassed Nirvana. When he comes to see that good person who seeks seclusion, 
  he arranges a seat and speaks the Dharma. He causes all of his listeners to 
  think they know their karma from the past. Or he may say to someone there, &quot;You 
  haven't died yet, but you have already become an animal.&quot; Then he instructs 
  another person to step on the first person's &quot;tail&quot;, and suddenly 
  the first person cannot stand up. At that point, all in the assembly pour out 
  their hearts in respect and admiration for him. If someone has a thought, the 
  demon detects it immediately. He establishes intense ascetic practices that 
  exceed the Buddha's moral precepts. He slanders Bhikshus, scolds his assembly 
  of disciples, and exposes people's private affairs without fear of ridicule 
  or rejection. He is fond of foretelling calamities and auspicious events, and 
  when they come to pass, he is not wrong in the slightest. <br>
  This is a ghost with great powers that in its old age has become a demon. It 
  disturbs and confuses the good person. But when it tires of doing so, it will 
  leave the other person's body. Then both the disciples and the teacher will 
  get in trouble with the law. You should be aware of this in advance and not 
  get caught up in the cycle of transmigration. If you are confused and do not 
  understand, you will fall into the Relentless Hells. <br>
  Further, in the unhindered clarity and wonder that ensues after the feeling 
  Skandha is gone, this good person is untroubled by any deviant mental state 
  and experiences perfect, bright concentration. Within Samadhi, his mind craves 
  more knowledge and understanding, so he diligently toils at examining and probing 
  as he greedily seeks to know past lives. <br>
  At that time a demon from the heavens seizes the opportunity it has been waiting 
  for. Its spirit possesses another person and uses him as a mouthpiece to expound 
  the Sutras and the Dharma. This person, unaware that he is possessed by a demon, 
  claims he has reached unsurpassed Nirvana. When he comes to see that good person 
  who seeks knowledge, he arranges a seat and speaks the Dharma. <br>
  There in the Dharma Assembly, inexplicably, that person may obtain an enormous 
  precious pearl. The demon may sometimes change into an animal that holds the 
  pearl or other jewels, bamboo tablets, tallies, talismans, letters, and other 
  unusual things in its mouth. The demon first gives the objects to the person 
  and afterwards possesses him. Or he may fool his audience by burying the objects 
  underground and then saying that a &quot;moonlight pearl&quot; is illuminating 
  the place. Thereupon the audience feels they have obtained something unique. 
  He may eat only medicinal herbs and not partake of prepared food. Or he may 
  eat only one sesame seed and one grain of wheat a day and still look robust. 
  That is because he is sustained by the power of the demon. He slanders Bhikshus 
  and scolds his assembly of disciples without fear of ridicule or rejection. 
  <br>
  He is fond of talking about treasure troves in other locations, or of remote 
  and hidden places where sages and worthies of the ten directions dwell. Those 
  who follow him often see strange and unusual people. <br>
  This is a ghost or spirit of the mountain forests, earth, cities, rivers, and 
  mountains that in its old age has become a demon. The person it possesses may 
  advocate promiscuity and violate the Buddha's precepts. He may covertly indulge 
  in the five desires with his followers. Or he may appear to be vigorous, eating 
  only wild plants. His behaviour is erratic, and he disturbs and confuses the 
  good person. But when the demon tires, it will leave the other person's body. 
  Then both the disciples and the teacher will get in trouble with the law. <br>
  You should be aware of this in advance and not get caught up in the cycle of 
  transmigration. If you are confused and do not understand, you will fall into 
  the Relentless Hells. <br>
  Further, in the unhindered clarity and wonder that ensues after the feeling 
  Skandha is gone, this good person is untroubled by any deviant mental state 
  and experiences perfect, bright concentration. Within Samadhi, his mind craves 
  spiritual powers and all manner of transformations, so he investigates the source 
  of transformations as he greedily seeks for spiritual powers. <br>
  At that time a demon from the heavens seizes the opportunity it has been waiting 
  for. Its spirit possesses another person and uses him as a mouthpiece to expound 
  the Sutras and the Dharma. <br>
  This person, truly unaware that he is possessed by a demon, also claims he has 
  reached unsurpassed Nirvana. When he comes to see that good person who seeks 
  spiritual powers, he arranges a seat and speaks the Dharma. The possessed person 
  may hold fire in his hands and, grasping a portion of it, put a flame on the 
  head of each listener in the Fourfold Assembly. The flames on top of their heads 
  are several feet high, yet they are not hot and no one is burned. Or he may 
  walk on water as if on dry land; or he may sit motionless in the air; or he 
  may enter into a bottle or stay in a bag; or he may pass through window panes 
  and walls without obstruction. Only when attacked by weapons does he feel ill 
  at ease. He declares himself to be a Buddha and, wearing the clothing of a lay 
  person, receives bows from Bhikshus. He slanders Dhyana meditation and the moral 
  regulations. He scolds his disciples and exposes people's private affairs without 
  fear of ridicule or rejection.<br>
  He often talks about spiritual powers and self-mastery. He may cause people 
  to see visions of Buddhalands, but they are unreal and arise merely from the 
  ghost's power to delude people. He praises the indulgence of lust and does not 
  condemn lewd conduct. He uses indecent means to transmit his Dharma. <br>
  This is a powerful nature spirit: a mountain sprite, a sea sprite, a wind sprite, 
  a river sprite, an earth sprite, or a grass-and-tree sprite that has evolved 
  over long ages. It may be a dragon-goblin; or a Rishi who has been reborn as 
  a goblin; or again a Rishi who, having reached the end of his appointed time, 
  <br>
  should have died, but whose body does not decay and is possessed by a goblin. 
  In its old age it has become a demon. It disturbs and confuses the good person. 
  But when it tires of doing so, it will leave the other person's body. Then both 
  the disciples and the teacher will get in trouble with the law. <br>
  You should be aware of this in advance and not get caught up in the cycle of 
  transmigration. If you are confused and do not understand, you will fall into 
  the Relentless Hells. <br>
  Further, in the unhindered clarity and wonder that ensues after the feeling 
  Skandha is gone, this good person is untroubled by any deviant mental state 
  and experiences perfect, bright concentration. Within Samadhi, his mind craves 
  to enter cessation, so he investigates the nature of transformations as he greedily 
  seeks for profound emptiness. <br>
  At that time a demon from the heavens seizes the opportunity it has been waiting 
  for. Its spirit possesses another person and uses him as a mouthpiece to expound 
  the Sutras and the Dharma. <br>
  This person, unaware that he is possessed by a demon, claims he has reached 
  unsurpassed Nirvana. When he comes to see that good person who seeks emptiness, 
  he arranges a seat and speaks the Dharma. In the midst of the great assembly, 
  his physical form suddenly disappears, and no one in the assembly can see him. 
  Then out of nowhere, he abruptly reappears. He <br>
  can appear and disappear at will, or he can make his body transparent like crystal. 
  From his hands and feet he releases the fragrance of sandalwood, or his excrement 
  and urine may be sweet as thick rock candy. He slanders the precepts and is 
  contemptuous of those who have left the home life.<br>
  He often says that there is no cause and no effect, that once we die, we are 
  gone forever, that there is no afterlife, and that there are no ordinary people 
  and no sages. Although he has obtained a state of empty stillness, he covertly 
  indulges his greedy desires. Those who give in to his lust also adopt his views 
  of emptiness and deny cause and effect. <br>
  This is an essence that was created during an eclipse of the sun or moon. Having 
  fallen on gold, jade, a rare fungus, a unicorn, a phoenix, a tortoise, or a 
  crane, the essence endowed it with life, so that it did not die for thousands 
  or tens of thousands of years and eventually became a spirit. It was then born 
  into this land and in its old age has become a demon. It disturbs and confuses 
  the good person. But when it tires of doing so, it will leave the other person's 
  body. Then both the disciples and the teacher will get in trouble with the law. 
  <br>
  You should be aware of this in advance and not get caught up in the cycle of 
  transmigration. If you are confused and do not understand, you will fall into 
  the Relentless Hells. <br>
  Further, in the unhindered clarity and wonder that ensues after the feeling 
  Skandha is gone, this good person is untroubled by any deviant mental state 
  and experiences perfect, bright concentration. Within Samadhi, his mind craves 
  long life, so he toils at investigating its subtleties as he greedily seeks 
  for immortality. He wishes to cast aside the birth and death of the body, and 
  suddenly he hopes to end the birth and death of thoughts as well, so that he 
  can abide forever in a subtle form. <br>
  At that time a demon from the heavens seizes the opportunity it has been waiting 
  for. Its spirit possesses another person and uses him as a mouthpiece to expound 
  the Sutras and the Dharma.<br>
  This person, unaware that he is possessed by a demon, claims he has reached 
  unsurpassed Nirvana. When he comes to see that good person who seeks long life, 
  he arranges a seat and speaks the Dharma. He is fond of saying that he can go 
  places and come back without hindrance, perhaps traveling ten thousand miles 
  and returning in the twinkling of an eye. He can also bring things back from 
  wherever he goes. Or he may tell someone to walk from one end of the room to 
  the other, a distance of just a few paces. Then even if the person walked fast 
  for years, he could not reach the wall. Therefore people believe in the possessed 
  person and mistake him for a Buddha. <br>
  He often says, &quot;All beings in the ten directions are my children. I gave 
  birth to all Buddhas. I created the world. I am the original Buddha. I created 
  this world naturally, not due to cultivation.<br>
  This may be a Chamunda sent from the retinue of the demon in the Heaven of Sovereignty, 
  or a youthful Pishacha from the Heaven of the Four Kings that has not yet brought 
  forth the resolve. It takes advantage of the person's luminous clarity and devours 
  his essence and energy. Or perhaps without having to rely on a teacher, the 
  cultivator personally sees a being that tells him, &quot;I am a Vajra Spirit 
  who has come to give you long life.&quot; Or the being transforms itself into 
  a beautiful woman and engages him in frenzied lust, so that within a year his 
  vitality is exhausted. He talks to himself; and to anyone listening he sounds 
  like a goblin. The people around him do not realize what is happening. In most 
  cases such a person will get in trouble with the law. But before he is punished, 
  he will die from depletion. The demon disturbs and confuses the person to the 
  point of death. <br>
  You should be aware of this in advance and not get caught up in the cycle of 
  transmigration. If you are confused and do not understand, you will fall into 
  the Relentless Hells. <br>
  Ananda, you should know that in the Dharma-ending Age, these ten kinds of demons 
  may leave the home-life to cultivate the Way within my Dharma. They may possess 
  other people, or they may manifest themselves in various forms. All of them 
  will claim that they have already accomplished Proper and Pervasive Knowledge 
  and Awareness. <br>
  They praise lust and break the Buddha's moral precepts. The evil demonic teachers 
  and their demonic disciples that I just discussed transmit their teaching through 
  licentious activity. Such deviant spirits take over cultivator's minds, and 
  after as few as nine lives or as many as a hundred generations, they turn true 
  practitioners entirely into followers of demons. <br>
  When their lives are over, they are bound to end up as one of the demonic hordes. 
  They will lose their proper and pervasive knowledge and fall into the Relentless 
  Hells. <br>
  You need not enter Nirvana yet. Although you are completing your attainment 
  to the level beyond study, hold nonetheless to your vows to enter the Dharma-ending 
  Age. Bring forth great compassion to rescue and take across living beings who 
  have proper minds and deep faith. Do not let them become possessed by demons. 
  Help them instead to attain proper knowledge and views. I have already rescued 
  you from birth and death. By venerating the Buddha's words, you will be repaying 
  the Buddha's kindness.<br>
  Ananda, all ten of these states may occur in Dhyana as one's mental effort interacts 
  with the thinking Skandha. <br>
  Dull and confused living beings do not evaluate themselves. Encountering such 
  situations, in their confusion they fail to recognize them and say that they 
  have become sages, thereby uttering a great lie. They will fall into the Relentless 
  Hells. <br>
  In the Dharma-ending Age, after my Nirvana, all of you should pass on the Tathagata's 
  teachings, so that all living beings can awaken to their meaning. Do not let 
  the demons of the heavens have their way. Offer protection so that all can realize 
  the unsurpassed Way.<br>
  FORMATIONS SKANDHA<br>
  Ananda, when the good person who is cultivating Samadhi has put an end to the 
  thinking Skandha, he is ordinarily free of dreaming and idle thinking, so he 
  stays the same whether in wakefulness or in sleep. His mind is aware, clear, 
  empty, and still, like a cloudless sky, devoid of any coarse sense-impressions. 
  He contemplates everything in the world-the mountains, the rivers, and the earth-as 
  reflections in a mirror, appearing without attachment and vanishing without 
  any trace; they are simply received and reflected. He does away with all his 
  old habits, and only the essential truth remains. <br>
  From this point on, as the origin of production and destruction is exposed, 
  he will completely see all the twelve categories of living beings in the ten 
  directions. Although he has not fathomed the source of their individual lives, 
  he will see that they share a common basis of life, which appears as a mirage 
  --shimmering and fluctuating--and is the ultimate, pivotal point of the illusory 
  sense faculties and sense objects. This is the region of the formations Skandha. 
  <br>
  Once the basic nature of this shimmering fluctuation returns to its original 
  clarity, his habits will cease, like waves subsiding to become clear, calm water. 
  This is the end of the formations Skandha. This person will then be able to 
  transcend the turbidity of living beings. Contemplating the cause of the formations 
  Skandha, one sees that subtle and hidden false thoughts are its source. <br>
  Ananda, you should know that when the good person has obtained proper knowledge 
  in his practice of Shamatha, his mind is unmoving, clear, and proper, and it 
  cannot be disturbed by the ten kinds of demons from the heavens. He is now able 
  to intently and thoroughly investigate the origin of all categories of beings. 
  As the origin of each category becomes apparent, he can contemplate the source 
  of the subtle, fleeting, and pervasive fluctuation. But if he begins to speculate 
  on that pervasive source, he could fall into error with two theories of the 
  absence of cause. <br>
  First perhaps this person sees no cause for the origin of life. Why? Since he 
  has completely destroyed the mechanism of production, he can, by means of the 
  eight hundred merits of the eye organ, see all beings in the swirling flow of 
  Karma during eighty thousand eons, dying in one place and being reborn in another 
  as they undergo transmigration. But he cannot see beyond eighty thousand eons. 
  <br>
  Therefore, he concludes that for the last eighty thousand eons living beings 
  in the ten directions of this and other worlds have come into being without 
  any cause. <br>
  Because of this speculation, he will lose proper and pervasive knowledge, fall 
  into externalism, and become confused about the Bodhi nature. <br>
  Second, perhaps this person sees no cause for the end of life. And why? Since 
  he perceives the origin of life, he believes that people are always born as 
  people and birds are always born as birds; that crows have always been black 
  and swans have always been white; that humans and gods have always stood upright 
  and animals have always walked on four legs; that whiteness does not come from 
  being washed and blackness does not come from being dyed; and that there have 
  never been nor will there be any changes for eighty thousand eons. <br>
  He says, &quot;As I now examine to the end of this life, I find the same holds 
  true. In fact, I have never seen Bodhi, so how can there be such a thing as 
  the attainment of Bodhi? You should now realize that there is no cause for the 
  existence of any phenomena.&quot;<br>
  Because of this speculation, he will lose proper and pervasive knowledge, fall 
  into externalism, and become confused about the Bodhi nature. <br>
  This is the first external teaching, which postulates the absence of cause. 
  <br>
  Ananda, in his practice of Samadhi, the good person's mind is unmoving, clear, 
  and proper and can no longer be disturbed by demons. He can thoroughly investigate 
  the origin of all categories of beings and contemplate the source of the subtle, 
  fleeting, and constant fluctuation. But if he begins to speculate on its pervasive 
  constancy, he could fall into error with four theories of pervasive permanence. 
  <br>
  First, as this person thoroughly investigates the mind and its states, he may 
  conclude that both are causeless. Through his cultivation, he knows that in 
  twenty thousand eons, as beings in the ten directions undergo endless rounds 
  of birth and death, they are never annihilated. Therefore, he speculates that 
  the mind and its states are permanent.<br>
  Second, as this person thoroughly investigates the source of the four elements, 
  he may conclude that they are permanent in nature. Through his cultivation, 
  he knows that in forty thousand eons, as living beings in the ten directions 
  undergo births and deaths, their substances exist permanently and are never 
  annihilated. Therefore, he speculates that this situation is permanent. <br>
  Third, as this person thoroughly investigates the sixth sense faculty, the Manas, 
  and the consciousness that grasps and receives, he concludes that the origin 
  of mind, intellect, and consciousness is permanent. Through his cultivation, 
  he knows that in eighty thousand eons, as all living beings in the ten directions 
  revolve in transmigration, this origin is never destroyed and exists permanently. 
  Investigating this undestroyed origin, he speculates that it is permanent. <br>
  Fourth, since this person has ended the source of thoughts, there is no more 
  reason for them to arise. In the state of flowing, halting, and turning, the 
  thinking mind -- which was the cause of production and destruction -- has now 
  ceased forever, and so he naturally thinks that this is a state of non-production 
  and non-destruction. As a result of such reasoning, he speculates that this 
  state is permanent. <br>
  Because of these speculations of permanence, he will lose proper and pervasive 
  knowledge, fall into externalism, and become confused about the Bodhi nature. 
  This is the second external teaching, which postulates pervasive permanence. 
  <br>
  Further, in his practice of Samadhi, the good person's mind is firm, unmoving, 
  and proper and can no longer be disturbed by demons. He can thoroughly investigate 
  the origin of all categories of beings and contemplate the source of the subtle, 
  fleeting, and constant fluctuation. But if he begins to speculate about self 
  and others, he could fall into error with theories of partial impermanence and 
  partial permanence based on four distorted views. <br>
  First, as this person contemplates the wonderfully bright mind pervading the 
  ten directions, he concludes that this state of profound stillness is the ultimate 
  spiritual self. Then he speculates, &quot;My spiritual self, that is settled, 
  bright and unmoving, pervades the ten directions. All living beings are within 
  my mind, and there they are born and die by themselves. Therefore, my mind is 
  permanent while those who undergo birth and death there are truly impermanent.&quot;<br>
  Second, instead of contemplating his own mind, this person contemplates in the 
  ten directions worlds as many as the Ganges' sands. He regards as ultimately 
  impermanent those worlds that are in eons of decay, and as ultimately permanent 
  those that are not in eons of decay. <br>
  Third, this person closely examines his own mind and finds it to be subtle and 
  mysterious, like fine motes of dust swirling in the ten directions, unchanging 
  in nature. And yet it can cause his body to be born and then to die. He regards 
  that indestructible nature as his permanent intrinsic nature, and that which 
  undergoes birth and death and flows forth from him as impermanent.<br>
  Fourth, knowing that the Skandha of thinking has ended and seeing the flowing 
  of the Skandha of formations, this person speculates that the continuous flow 
  of the Skandha of formations is permanent, and that the Skandhas of form, feeling, 
  and thinking which have already ended are impermanent. <br>
  Because of these speculations of impermanence and permanence, he will fall into 
  externalism and become confused about the Bodhi nature. This is the third external 
  teaching, which postulates partial permanence. <br>
  Further, in his practice of Samadhi, the good person's mind is firm, unmoving, 
  and proper and can no longer be disturbed by demons. He can thoroughly investigate 
  the origin of all categories of beings and contemplate the source of the subtle, 
  fleeting, and constant fluctuation. But if he begins to speculate about the 
  making of certain distinctions, he could fall into error with four theories 
  of finiteness.<br>
  First, this person speculates that the origin of life flows and functions ceaselessly. 
  He judges that the past and the future are finite and that the continuity of 
  the mind is infinite.<br>
  Second, as this person contemplates an interval of eighty thousand eons, he 
  can see living beings; but earlier than eighty thousand eons is a time of stillness 
  in which he cannot hear or see anything. He regards as infinite that time in 
  which nothing is heard or seen, and as finite that interval in which living 
  beings are seen to exist. <br>
  Third, this person speculates that his own pervasive knowledge is infinite and 
  that all other people appear within his awareness. And yet, since he himself 
  has never perceived the nature of their awareness, he says they have not obtained 
  an infinite mind, but have only a finite one. <br>
  Fourth, this person thoroughly investigates the formations Skandha to the point 
  that it becomes empty. Based on what he sees, in his mind he speculates that 
  each and every living being, in its given body, is half living and half dead. 
  From this he concludes that everything in the world is half finite and half 
  infinite. <br>
  Because of these speculations about the finite and the infinite, he will fall 
  into externalism and become confused about the Bodhi nature. This is the fourth 
  external teaching, which postulates finiteness.<br>
  Further, in his practice of Samadhi, the good person's mind is firm, unmoving, 
  and proper and can no longer be disturbed by demons. He can thoroughly investigate 
  the origin of all categories of beings and contemplate the source of the subtle, 
  fleeting, and constant fluctuation. But if he begins to speculate on what he 
  knows and sees, he could fall into error with four distorted, false theories, 
  which are total speculation based on the sophistry of immortality. <br>
  First, this person contemplates the source of transformations. Seeing the movement 
  and flow, he says there is change. Seeing the continuity, he says there is constancy. 
  Where he can perceive something, he says there is production. Where he cannot 
  perceive anything, he says there is destruction. He says that the unbroken continuity 
  of causes is increasing and that the pauses within the continuity are decreasing. 
  He says that the arising of all things is existence and that the perishing of 
  all things is non-existence. The light of reason shows that his application 
  of mind has led to inconsistent views. If someone comes to seek the Dharma, 
  asking about its meaning, he replies, &quot;I am both alive and dead, both existent 
  and non-existent, both increasing and decreasing.&quot; He always speaks in 
  a confusing way, causing that person to forget what he was going to say. <br>
  Second, this person attentively contemplates his mind and finds that everything 
  is non-existent. He has a realization based on non-existence. When anyone comes 
  to ask him questions, he replies with only one word. He only says &quot;no.&quot; 
  Aside from saying &quot;no,&quot; he does not speak. <br>
  Third, this person attentively contemplates his mind and finds that everything 
  is existent. He has a realization based on existence. When anyone comes to ask 
  him questions, he replies with only one word. He only says &quot;yes&quot;. 
  Aside from saying &quot;yes&quot;, he does not speak. <br>
  Fourth, this person perceives both existence and non-existence. Experiencing 
  this branching, his mind becomes confused. When anyone comes to ask questions, 
  he tells them, &quot;Existence is also non-existence. But within non-existence 
  there is no existence.&quot; It is all sophistry and does not stand up under 
  scrutiny. <br>
  Because of these speculations, which are empty sophistries, he will fall into 
  externalism and become confused about the Bodhi nature. This is the fifth external 
  teaching, which postulates four distorted, false theories that are total speculation 
  based on the sophistry of immortality. <br>
  Further, in his practice of Samadhi, the good person's mind is firm, unmoving, 
  and proper and can no longer be disturbed by demons. He can thoroughly investigate 
  the origin of all categories of beings and contemplate the source of the subtle, 
  fleeting, and constant fluctuation. But if he begins to speculate on the endless 
  flow, he could fall into error with the confused idea that forms exist after 
  death. <br>
  He may strongly identify with his body and say that form is himself; or he may 
  see himself as perfectly encompassing all worlds and say that he contains form; 
  or he may perceive all external conditions as contingent upon himself and say 
  that form belongs to him; or he may decide that he relies on the continuity 
  of the formations Skandha and say that he is within form. <br>
  In all of these speculations, he says that forms exist after death. Expanding 
  the idea, he comes up with sixteen cases of the existence of forms. <br>
  Then he may speculate that afflictions are always afflictions, and Bodhi is 
  always Bodhi, and the two exist side by side without contradicting each other. 
  <br>
  Because of these speculations about what exists after death, he will fall into 
  externalism and become confused about the Bodhi nature. This is the sixth external 
  teaching, which postulates confused theories of the existence of forms after 
  death in the realm of the five Skandhas. <br>
  Further, in his practice of Samadhi, the good person's mind is firm, unmoving, 
  and proper, and can no longer be disturbed by demons. He can thoroughly investigate 
  the origin of all categories of beings and contemplate the source of the subtle, 
  fleeting, and constant fluctuation. But if he begins to speculate on the Skandhas 
  of form, feeling, and thinking, which have already ended, he could fall into 
  error with the confused idea that forms do not exist after death. <br>
  Seeing that his form is gone, his physical shape seems to lack a cause. As he 
  contemplates the absence of thought, there is nothing to which his mind can 
  become attached. Knowing that his feelings are gone, he has no further involvements. 
  Those Skandhas have vanished. Although there is still some coming into being, 
  there is no feeling or thought, and he concludes that he is like grass or wood. 
  <br>
  Since those qualities do not exist at present, how can there be any existence 
  of forms after death? Because of his examinations and comparisons, he decides 
  that after death there is no existence. Expanding the idea, he comes up with 
  eight cases of the non-existence of forms. <br>
  From that, he may speculate that Nirvana and cause and effect are all empty, 
  that they are mere names and ultimately do not exist. <br>
  Because of those speculations that forms do not exist after death, he will fall 
  into externalism and become confused about the Bodhi nature. This is the seventh 
  external teaching, which postulates confused theories of the non-existence of 
  forms after death in the realm of the five Skandhas. <br>
  Further, in his practice of Samadhi, the good person's mind is firm, unmoving, 
  and proper and can no longer be disturbed by demons. He can thoroughly investigate 
  the origin of all categories of beings and contemplate the source of the subtle, 
  fleeting, and constant fluctuation. In this state where the Skandha of formations 
  remains, but the Skandhas of feeling and thinking are gone, if he begins to 
  speculate that there is both existence and non-existence, thus contradicting 
  himself, he could fall into error with confused theories that deny both existence 
  and non-existence after death. <br>
  Regarding form, feeling, and thinking, he sees that existence is not really 
  existence. Within the flow of the formations Skandha, he sees that non-existence 
  is not really non-existence. <br>
  Considering back and forth in this way, he thoroughly investigates the realms 
  of these Skandhas and derives an eightfold negation of forms. No matter which 
  Skandha is mentioned, he says that after death, it neither exists nor does not 
  exist. <br>
  Further, because he speculates that all formations are changing in nature, an 
  &quot;insight&quot; flashes through his mind, leading him to deny both existence 
  and non-existence. He cannot determine what is unreal and what is real. <br>
  Because of these speculations that deny both existence and non-existence after 
  death, the future is murky to him and he cannot say anything about it. Therefore, 
  he will fall into externalism and become confused about the Bodhi nature. This 
  is the eighth external teaching, which postulates confused theories that deny 
  both existence and non-existence after death in the realm of the five Skandhas. 
  <br>
  Further, in his practice of Samadhi, the good person's mind is firm, unmoving, 
  and proper and can no longer be disturbed by demons. He can thoroughly investigate 
  the origin of all categories of beings and contemplate the source of the subtle, 
  fleeting, and constant fluctuation. But if he begins to speculate that there 
  is no existence after death, he could fall into error with seven theories of 
  the cessation of existence. <br>
  He may speculate that the body will cease to exist or that when desire has ended, 
  there is cessation of existence; or that after suffering has ended, there is 
  cessation of existence; or that when bliss reaches an ultimate point, there 
  is cessation of existence; or that when renunciation reaches an ultimate point 
  there is cessation of existence. <br>
  Considering back and forth in this way, he exhaustively investigates the limits 
  of the seven states and sees that they have already ceased to be and will not 
  exist again. <br>
  Because of these speculations that existence ceases after death, he will fall 
  into externalism and become confused about the Bodhi nature. This is the ninth 
  external teaching, which postulates confused theories of the cessation of existence 
  after death in the realm of the five Skandhas. <br>
  Further, in his practice of Samadhi, the good person's mind is firm, unmoving, 
  and proper and can no longer be disturbed by demons. He can thoroughly investigate 
  the origin of all categories of beings and contemplate the source of the subtle, 
  fleeting, and constant fluctuation. But if he begins to speculate on existence 
  after death, he could fall into error with five theories of Nirvana. <br>
  He may consider the heavens of the Desire Realm a true refuge, because he contemplates 
  their extensive brightness and longs for it; or he may take refuge in the First 
  Dhyana, because there his nature is free from worry; or he may take refuge in 
  the Second Dhyana, because there his mind is free from suffering; or he may 
  take refuge in the Third Dhyana, because he delights in its extreme joy; or 
  he may take refuge in the Fourth Dhyana, reasoning that suffering and bliss 
  are both ended there and that he will no longer undergo transmigration. <br>
  These heavens are subject to outflows, but in his confusion he thinks that they 
  are unconditioned; and he takes these five states of tranquility to be refuges 
  of supreme purity. Considering back and forth in this way, he decides that these 
  five states are ultimate. <br>
  Because of these speculations about five kinds of immediate Nirvana, he will 
  fall into externalism and become confused about the Bodhi nature. This is the 
  tenth external teaching, which postulates confused theories of five kinds of 
  immediate Nirvana in the realm of the five Skandhas. <br>
  Ananda, all ten of these crazy explanations may occur in Dhyana as one's mental 
  effort interacts with the formations Skandha. That is why these &quot;insights&quot; 
  appear. <br>
  Dull and confused living beings do not evaluate themselves. Encountering such 
  situations, they mistake their confusion for understanding and say that they 
  have become sages, thereby uttering a great lie. They will fall into the Relentless 
  Hells. <br>
  After my Nirvana, all of you should pass on the Tathagata's teachings, transmitting 
  and revealing them to those in the Dharma-ending Age, so that living beings 
  everywhere can awaken to these truths. Do not let demons arise in their minds 
  and cause them to commit grave offences. Offer protection so that wrong views 
  will be eradicated. <br>
  Teach them to awaken to true principles in body and mind, so that they do not 
  stray off the Unsurpassed Path. Do not let them aspire to and be content with 
  small attainments. You should become kings of great enlightenment and serve 
  as guides of purity.<br>
  CONSCIOUSNESS SKANDHA<br>
  Ananda, when that good person, in cultivating Samadhi, has put an end to the 
  formations Skandha, the subtle, fleeting fluctuations-the deep, imperceptible, 
  pivotal source and the common foundation from which all life in the world springs-are 
  suddenly obliterated. In the submerged network of the retributive Karma of the 
  Pudgala, the Karmic resonance are interrupted. <br>
  There is about to be a great illumination in the sky of Nirvana. It is like 
  gazing east at the cock's final crow to see the light of dawn. The six sense 
  faculties are empty and still; there is no further racing about. Inside and 
  outside there is a profound brightness. He enters without entering. Fathoming 
  the source of life of the twelve categories of beings throughout the ten directions, 
  he can contemplate that source without being drawn into any of the categories. 
  He has become identical with the realms of the ten directions. The light does 
  not fade, and what was hidden before is now revealed. This is the region of 
  the consciousness Skandha.<br>
  If he has become identical with the beckoning masses, he may obliterate the 
  individuality of the six gates and succeed in uniting and opening them. Seeing 
  and hearing become linked so that they function interchangeably and purely. 
  The worlds of the ten directions and his own body and mind are as bright and 
  transparent as Vaidurya. This is the end of the consciousness Skandha. This 
  person can then transcend the turbidity of life spans. Contemplating the cause 
  of the consciousness Skandha, one sees that the negation of existence and the 
  negation of non-existence are both unreal, and that upside-down false thoughts 
  are its source. <br>
  Ananda, you should know that the good person has thoroughly seen the formations 
  Skandha as empty, and he return consciousness to the source. He has ended production 
  and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle wonder of ultimate 
  serenity. <br>
  He can cause the individual sense faculties of his body to unite and open. He 
  also has a pervasive awareness of all the categories of beings in the ten directions. 
  Since his awareness is pervasive, he can enter the perfect source. But if he 
  regards what he is returning to as the cause of true permanence and interprets 
  this as a supreme state, he will fall into the error of holding to that cause. 
  Kapila the Sankhyan, with his theory of returning to the Truth of the Unmanifest, 
  will become his companion. Confused about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will 
  lose his knowledge and understanding. <br>
  This is the first state, in which he concludes that there is a place to which 
  to return, based on the idea that there is something to attain. He strays far 
  from perfect penetration and turns his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing 
  the seeds of externalism. <br>
  Further, Ananda, the good person has thoroughly seen the formations Skandha 
  as empty. He has ended production and destruction, but he has not yet perfected 
  the subtle wonder of ultimate serenity.<br>
  He may regard that to which he is returning as his own body and may see all 
  beings in the twelve categories throughout space as flowing forth from his body. 
  If he interprets this as a supreme state, he will fall into the error of maintaining 
  that he has an ability, which he does not really have. Maheshvara, who manifests 
  his boundless body, will become his companion. Confused about the Bodhi of the 
  Buddhas, he will lose his knowledge and understanding. <br>
  This is the second state, in which he draws conclusions about the workings of 
  an ability based on idea that he has such an ability. He strays far from perfect 
  penetration and turns his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds 
  for being born in the Heaven of Great Pride where the self is considered all-pervading 
  and perfect. <br>
  Further, the good person has thoroughly seen the formations Skandha as empty. 
  He has ended production and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle 
  wonder of ultimate serenity. <br>
  If he regards what he is returning to as a refuge, he will suspect that his 
  body and mind come forth from there, and that all things throughout space in 
  the ten directions arise from there as well. He will explain that place from 
  which all things issue forth is the truly permanent body, which is not subject 
  to production and destruction. While still within production and destruction, 
  he prematurely reckons that he abides in permanence. Since he is deluded about 
  non-production, he is also confused about production and destruction. He is 
  sunk in confusion. If he interprets this as a supreme state, he will fall <br>
  into the error of taking what is not permanent to be permanent. He will speculate 
  that the Sovereign God (Ishvaradeva) is his companion. Confused about the Bodhi 
  of the Buddhas, he will lose his knowledge and understanding. <br>
  This is the third state, in which he makes a false speculation based on the 
  idea that there is a refuge. He strays far from perfect penetration and turns 
  his back on the City of Nirvana thus sowing the seeds of a distorted view of 
  perfection. <br>
  Further, the good person has thoroughly seen the formations Skandha as empty. 
  He has ended production and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle 
  wonder of ultimate serenity. <br>
  Based on his idea that there is universal awareness, he formulates a theory 
  that all the plants in the ten directions are sentient, not different from human 
  beings. He claims that plants can become people, and that when people die they 
  again become plants in the ten directions. If he considers this idea of unrestricted, 
  universal awareness to be supreme, he will fall into the error of maintaining 
  that what is not aware has awareness. Vasishtha and Sainika, who maintained 
  the idea of comprehensive awareness, will become his companions. Confused about 
  the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will lose his knowledge and understanding.<br>
  This is the fourth state, in which he draws an erroneous conclusion based on 
  the idea that there is a universal awareness. He strays far from perfect penetration 
  and turns his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds of a distorted 
  view of awareness. <br>
  Further, the good person has thoroughly seen the formations Skandha as empty. 
  He has ended production and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle 
  wonder of ultimate serenity. <br>
  If he has attained versatility in the perfect fusion and interchangeable functioning 
  of the sense faculties, he may speculate that all things arise from these perfect 
  transformations. He then seeks the light of fire, delights in the purity of 
  water, loves the wind's circuitous flow, and contemplates the accomplishments 
  of the earth. He reveres and serves them all. He takes these mundane elements 
  to be a fundamental cause and considers them to be everlasting. He will then 
  fall into the error of taking what is not production to be production. Kashyapa 
  and the Brahmans who seek to transcend birth and death by diligently serving 
  fire and worshipping water will become his companions. Confused about the Bodhi 
  of the Buddhas, he will lose his knowledge and understanding. <br>
  This is the fifth state, in which he confusedly pursues the elements, setting 
  up a false cause that leads to false aspirations based on speculations about 
  his attachment to worship. He strays far from perfect penetration and turns 
  his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds of a distorted view of 
  transformation. <br>
  Further, the good person has thoroughly seen the formations Skandha as empty. 
  He has ended production and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle 
  wonder of ultimate serenity. <br>
  He may speculate that there is an emptiness within the perfect brightness, and 
  based on that he denies the myriad transformations, taking their eternal cessation 
  as his refuge. If he interprets this as a supreme state, he will fall into the 
  error of taking what is not a refuge to be a refuge. Those abiding in <br>
  the Shunyata of the Heaven of [Neither Thought nor] Non- Thought will become 
  his companions. Confused about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will lose his knowledge 
  and understanding. <br>
  This is the sixth state, in which he realizes a state of voidness based on the 
  idea of emptiness within the perfect brightness. He strays far from perfect 
  penetration and turns his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds 
  of annihilationism. <br>
  Further, the good person has thoroughly seen the formations Skandha as empty. 
  He has ended production and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle 
  wonder of ultimate serenity. <br>
  In the state of what seems to be perfect permanence, he may bolster his body, 
  hoping to live for a long time in that subtle and perfect condition without 
  dying. If he interprets this as a supreme state, he will fall into the error 
  of being greedy for something unattainable. Asita and those who seek long life 
  will become his companions. Confused about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will 
  lose his knowledge and understanding. <br>
  This is the seventh state, in which he sets up the false cause of bolstering 
  and aspires to permanent worldly existence, based on his attachment to the life-source. 
  He strays far from perfect penetration and turns his back on the City of Nirvana, 
  thus sowing the seeds for false thoughts of lengthening life. <br>
  Further, the good person has thoroughly seen the formations Skandha as empty. 
  He has ended production and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle 
  wonder of ultimate serenity. <br>
  As he contemplates the interconnection of all lives, he wants to hang on to 
  worldly enjoyments and is afraid they will come to an end. Caught up in this 
  thought, he will, by the power of transformation, seat himself in a lotus flower 
  palace, conjure up an abundance of the seven precious things, increase his retinue 
  of beautiful women, and indulge his mind. If he interprets this as a supreme 
  state, he will fall into the error of taking what is not the truth to be the 
  truth. Vignakara will become his companion. Confused about the Bodhi of the 
  Buddhas, he will lose his knowledge and understanding. <br>
  This is the eighth state, in which he decides to indulge in worldly enjoyments, 
  based on his wrong thinking. He strays far from perfect penetration and turns 
  his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds for becoming a demon 
  of the heavens. <br>
  Further, the good person has thoroughly seen the formations Skandha as empty. 
  He has ended production and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle 
  wonder of ultimate serenity. <br>
  In his understanding of life, he distinguishes the subtle and the coarse and 
  determines the true and the false. But he only seeks a response in the mutual 
  repayment of cause and effect, and he turns his back on the Way of Purity. In 
  the practice of seeing suffering, eliminating accumulation, realizing cessation, 
  and cultivating the Way, he dwells in cessation and stops there, making no further 
  progress. If he interprets this as a supreme state, he will fall and become 
  a fixed-nature Hearer. Unlearned Sanghans and those of overweening pride will 
  become his companions. Confused about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will lose 
  his knowledge and understanding. <br>
  This is the ninth state, in which he aspires toward the fruition of cessation, 
  based on perfecting the mind that seeks responses. He strays far from perfect 
  penetration and turns his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds 
  for becoming enmeshed in emptiness.<br>
  Further, the good person has thoroughly seen the formations Skandha as empty. 
  He has ended production and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle 
  wonder of ultimate serenity. <br>
  In that perfectly fused, pure, bright enlightenment, as he investigates the 
  profound wonder, he may take it to be Nirvana and fail to make further progress. 
  If he interprets this as a supreme state, he will fall and become a fixed-nature 
  Pratyeka. Those Enlightened by Conditions and Solitarily Enlightened Ones who 
  do not turn their minds to the Great Vehicle will become his companions. Confused 
  about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will lose his knowledge and understanding. 
  <br>
  This is the tenth state, in which he realizes a profound brightness based on 
  fusing the mind with perfect enlightenment. He strays far from perfect penetration 
  and turns his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds for being unable 
  to surpass his attachment to the brightness of perfect enlightenment. <br>
  Ananda, these ten states of Dhyana are due to crazy explanations on the path 
  of cultivation. Relying on them, the cultivator becomes confused and claims 
  to have attained complete realization before actually having done so. All these 
  states are the result of interactions between the consciousness Skandha and 
  his mental efforts. <br>
  Dull and confused living beings do not evaluate themselves. Encountering such 
  situations, their minds are confused by their individual likings and past habits, 
  so they stop to rest in what they take to be the ultimate refuge. They claim 
  to have perfected unsurpassed Bodhi, thus uttering a great lie. After their 
  Karmic retribution as externalists and deviant demons comes to an end, they 
  will fall into the Relentless Hells. The Hearers and Those Enlightened by Conditions 
  cannot make further progress. <br>
  All of you should cherish the resolve to sustain the Way of the Tathagata. After 
  my Nirvana, transmit this Dharma-door to those in the Dharma-ending Age, universally 
  causing living beings to awaken to its meaning. Do not let the demons of views 
  cause them to create their own grave offenses and fall. Protect, comfort, and 
  compassionately rescue them and dispel evil conditions. Enable them to enter 
  the Buddhas' knowledge and understanding with body and mind so that from the 
  beginning to the final accomplishment they never go astray. <br>
  CONCLUSION<br>
  It is by relying on this Dharma-door that the Tathagatas of the past, as many 
  as fine motes of dust in eons as many as the Ganges' sands, have enlightened 
  their minds and attained the Unsurpassed Way.<br>
  When the consciousness Skandha ends, your present sense faculties will function 
  interchangeably. Within that interchangeable functioning, you will be able to 
  enter the Bodhisattvas' Vajra Dry Wisdom. In your perfect, bright, pure mind, 
  there will be a transformation. <br>
  It will be like pure Vaidurya that contains a precious moon, and in that way 
  you will transcend the Ten Faiths, the Ten Dwellings, the Ten Practices, the 
  Ten Transferences, the Four Additional Practices, the Vajra-like Ten Grounds 
  of a Bodhisattva's practice, and the perfect brightness of Equal Enlightenment. 
  <br>
  You will enter the Tathagata's sea of wondrous adornments, perfect the cultivation 
  of Bodhi, and return to the state of non-attainment. <br>
  These are subtle demonic states that all Buddhas, World Honoured Ones, of the 
  past, discerned with their enlightened clarity while in the state of Shamatha 
  and Vipashyana. <br>
  If you can recognize a demonic state when it appears and wash away the filth 
  in your mind, you will not develop wrong views. <br>
  The demons of the Skandhas will melt away, and the demons from the heavens will 
  be destroyed. The mighty ghosts and spirits will lose their wits and flee. And 
  the Li. Mei, and Wang-liang will not dare to show themselves again. <br>
  You will directly arrive at Bodhi without the slightest weariness, progressing 
  from lower positions to Great Nirvana without becoming confused or discouraged. 
  <br>
  If there are beings in the Dharma-ending Age who delight in cultivating Samadhi, 
  but who are stupid and dull, who fail to recognize the importance of Dhyana, 
  or who have not heard the Dharma spoken, you should be concerned lest they get 
  caught up in deviant ways. You should single-mindedly exhort them to uphold 
  the Dharani Mantra of the Buddha's Summit. If they cannot recite it from memory, 
  they should have it written out and place it in the meditation hall or wear 
  it on their person. Then none of the demons will be able to disturb them. <br>
  You should revere this final paradigm of ultimate cultivation and progress of 
  the Tathagatas of the ten directions.<br>
  Ananda then arose from his seat. Having heard the Buddha's instruction, he bowed 
  and respectfully upheld it, remembering every word and forgetting none. Then 
  once more in the great assembly he spoke to the Buddha, &quot;The Buddha has 
  told us that in the manifestation of the five Skandhas, there are five kinds 
  of falseness that come from our own thinking minds. We have never before been 
  blessed with such subtle and wonderful instructions as the Tathagata has now 
  given. <br>
  Further, are these five Skandhas destroyed all at the same time, or are they 
  extinguished in sequence? What are the boundaries of these five layers? <br>
  We only hope the Tathagata, out of great compassion, will explain this in order 
  to purify the eyes and illuminate the minds of those in the great assembly, 
  and in order to serve as eyes for living beings of the future.<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, &quot;The essential, true, wonderful brightness and 
  perfect purity of basic enlightenment does not admit birth and death, nor any 
  mundane defilements, nor even empty space itself. All these are brought forth 
  because of false thinking. <br>
  The source of basic enlightenment, which is wonderfully bright, true, and pure, 
  falsely gives rise to the material world, just as Yajnadatta became confused 
  about his head when he saw his own reflection. <br>
  The falseness basically has no cause, but in your false thinking, you set up 
  causes and conditions. But those who are confused about the principle of causes 
  and conditions call it spontaneity. Even empty space is an illusory creation; 
  how much the more so are causes and conditions and spontaneity, <br>
  which are mere speculations made by the false minds of living beings. <br>
  Ananda, if you perceive the arising of falseness, you can speak of the causes 
  and conditions of that falseness. But if the falseness has no source, you will 
  have to say that the causes and conditions of that falseness basically have 
  no source. How much the more is this the case for those who fail to understand 
  this and advocate spontaneity. <br>
  Therefore, the Tathagata has explained to you that the fundamental cause of 
  all five Skandhas is false thinking.<br>
  Your body's initial cause was a thought on the part of your parents. But if 
  you had not entertained any thought in your own mind, you would not have been 
  born. Life is perpetuated by means of thought. <br>
  As I have said before, when you call to mind the taste of vinegar, your mouth 
  waters. When you think of walking along a precipice, the soles of your feet 
  tingle. Since the precipice doesn't exist and there isn't any vinegar, how could 
  your mouth water at the mere mention of vinegar, if it were not the case that 
  your body originated from falseness? <br>
  Therefore, you should know that your present physical body is brought about 
  by the first kind of false thinking, which is characterized by solidity. <br>
  As described earlier, merely thinking about a high place can cause your body 
  to tingle and ache.<br>
  Due to that cause, feelings arise and affect your body, so that at present you 
  pursue pleasant feelings and are repelled by unpleasant feelings. These two 
  kinds of feelings that compel you are brought about by the second kind of false 
  thinking, which is characterized by illusory clarity. <br>
  Once your thoughts arise, they can control your body. Since your body is not 
  the same as your thoughts, why is it that your body follows your thoughts and 
  engages in every sort of grasping at objects? A thought arises, and the body 
  grasps at things in response to the thought. <br>
  When you are awake, your mind thinks. When you are asleep, you dream. Thus your 
  thinking is stirred to perceive false situations. This is the third kind of 
  false thinking, which is characterized by interconnectedness. <br>
  The metabolic processes never stop; they progress through subtle changes: your 
  nails and hair grow, your energy wanes, and your skin becomes wrinkled. These 
  processes continue day and night, and yet you never wake up to them. <br>
  If these things aren't part of you, Ananda, then why does your body keep changing? 
  And if they are really part of you, then why aren't you aware of them? <br>
  Your formations Skandha continues in thought after thought without cease. It 
  is the fourth kind of false thinking, which is subtle and hidden. <br>
  Finally, if your pure, bright, clear, and unmoving state is permanent, then 
  there should be no seeing, hearing, awareness, or knowing in your body. If it 
  is genuinely pure and true, it should not contain habits or falseness.<br>
  How does it happen, then, that having seen some unusual thing in the past, you 
  eventually forget it over time, until neither memory nor forgetfulness of it 
  remain; but then later, upon suddenly seeing that unusual thing again, you remember 
  it clearly from before without forgetting a single detail? How can you keep 
  track of the permeation that goes on in thought after thought in this pure, 
  clear, and unmoving consciousness? <br>
  Ananda, you should know that this state of clarity is not real. It is like rapidly 
  flowing water that appears to be still on the surface. Due to its speed you 
  cannot perceive the flow, but that does not mean it is not flowing. If this 
  were not the source of thinking, then how could one be subject to false habits? 
  <br>
  If you do not open and unite your six sense faculties so that they function 
  interchangeably, this false thinking will never cease. <br>
  That's why your seeing, hearing, awareness, and knowing are presently strung 
  together by subtle habits, so that within the profound clarity, existence and 
  non-existence are both unreal. This is the fifth kind of upside-down, minutely 
  subtle thinking. <br>
  Ananda, these five Skandhas of reception develop with five kinds of false thinking. 
  <br>
  You also wanted to know the depth and scope of each realm. Form and emptiness 
  are the boundaries of form. Contact and separation are the boundaries of feeling. 
  Remembering and forgetting are the boundaries of thinking. Destruction and production 
  are the boundaries of formations. Deep purity entering to unite with deep purity 
  belongs to the boundaries of consciousness. <br>
  At their source, these five Skandhas arise in layers. Their arising is due to 
  consciousness, while their cessation begins with the elimination of form. <br>
  You may have a sudden awakening to the principle, at which point they all simultaneously 
  vanish. But in terms of the specifics, they are eliminated not all at once, 
  but in sequence. <br>
  I have already shown you the knots tied in the Karpasa cloth. What is it that 
  you do not understand, that causes you to ask about it again? <br>
  You should gain a thorough understanding of the origin of this false thinking 
  and then transmit your understanding to cultivators in the future Dharma-ending 
  Age. Let them recognize this falseness and naturally give rise to deep disdain 
  for it. Let them know of Nirvana so that they will not linger in the Triple 
  Realm. <br>
  Ananda, suppose someone were to fill up all the space in the ten directions 
  with the seven precious things and then present them as an offering to Buddhas 
  as numerous as motes of dust, with his mind set on serving and making offerings 
  to them in thought after thought. Do you think this person would reap many blessings 
  from making such an offering to the Buddhas?<br>
  Ananda answered, Since space is limitless, the precious things would be boundless. 
  In the past, someone gave the Buddha seven coins and consequently was reborn 
  as a Wheel-turning King in his next life. As to this person who now fills up 
  all of space and all the Buddhalands with an offering of precious things that 
  could not be reckoned through endless eons, how could there be a limit to his 
  blessings?&quot;<br>
  The Buddha told Ananda, All Buddhas, Tathagatas, speak words which are not false. 
  There might be another person who had personally committed the four major offenses 
  and the ten Parajikas so that, in an instant he would have to pass through the 
  Avichi Hells in this world and other worlds, until he had passed through all 
  the Relentless Hells in the ten directions without exception. <br>
  And yet if he could explain this Dharma-door for just the space of a thought 
  to those in the Dharma-ending Age who have not yet studied it, his obstacles 
  from offences would be eradicated in response to that thought, and all the hells 
  where he was to undergo suffering would become lands of peace and bliss. <br>
  The blessings he would obtain would surpass those of the person previously mentioned 
  by hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of times, indeed by so many 
  times that no calculations or analogies could express it. <br>
  Ananda, if living beings are able to recite this Sutra and uphold this mantra, 
  I could not describe in endless eons how great the benefits will be. Rely on 
  the teaching I have spoken. Cultivate in accord with it, and you will directly 
  realize Bodhi without encountering demonic karma.<br>
  When the Buddha finished speaking this Sutra, the Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upasakas, 
  Upasikas, and all the gods, humans, and asuras in this world, as well as all 
  the Bodhisattvas, those of the Two Vehicles, sages, immortals, and pure youths 
  in other directions, and the mighty ghosts and spirits of initial resolve all 
  felt elated, made obeisance, and withdrew.</b></p>
